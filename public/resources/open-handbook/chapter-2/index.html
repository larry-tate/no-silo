<p>&ldquo;We believe the best way to work on a difficult text is by rereading
. . . but you can also work on the difficult text by writing, by
taking possession of the work through sentences and paragraphs of your
own, through summary, paraphrase, and quotation, by making another
writer&rsquo;s work part of your work&rdquo; (12).</p>
<p>Bartholomae and Petrosky, &ldquo;Introduction.&rdquo; <em>Ways of Reading: An
Anthology for Writers</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="taking-critical-notes">Taking Critical Notes</h2>
<p>One objective of the annotations described in the previous chapter is to
help you create a <code>critical outline</code> during a subsequent reading. The
objective in the critical outline is to boil the entire argument down to
its essence, without losing any significant detail. The name of the game
here is <code>reduction</code>: taking something complex and unwieldy and turning it
into something small and useful for study or your own writing. There is
a real art to this, and you will become better and faster at this as you
practice. Over time, you will train your mind to operate in such a way
that you will perform these tasks almost unconsciously as you read.
These critical notes will be indispensable study aids. They will also
dramatically improve your writing.</p>
<p>These critical summaries are comprised of nothing more than <code>summary</code>, <code>paraphrase</code>, <code>quotation</code>, and your own observations and questions. Quote only the most important, memorable language.
Summarize or paraphrase the rest in as objective a manner as possible.
Take great care when summarizing or paraphrasing; if your work is too
similar to the original text and is used later in your own writing, <em>you
may inadvertently commit <a href="plagiarism"><code>plagiarism</code></a></em>, a serious academic offense.
Therefore, carefully place the writing of others into your own words and
<a href="#citation"><code>cite</code></a> the text and ideas you reference in your notes.</p>
<p>As you write this critical outline you will not only try to reduce the
main points of the argument, you will also ask questions and make
observations of the text. You should note the argumentative points that
you find yourself strongly agreeing or disagreeing with and your reasons
for doing so. You might see a logical inconsistency or want the author
to provide more evidence for his or her claims. You might make a note to
perform some research at the library or on the Internet on an unfamiliar
concept or event mentioned in the argument. Ultimately, however, you
will want to determine if the <a href=""><code>argument</code></a> you have read is persuasive and
provide the reasons why.</p>
<p>At the end of this process, you should have a simplified&mdash;but objective
and accurate&mdash;version of the essay that has been ruthlessly cut down to
its bare essentials as well as a number of critical observations,
questions, and ideas that have emerged in your process of reading. By
the time you reach this stage and read over your notes, you will have
taken great strides toward mastering the information or argument. Of
course, if the text is difficult, you may have to repeat the process
until you have a breakthrough. I cannot emphasize enough how helpful and
important this process is. It will help you come to a greater
understanding of the text&rsquo;s claims and weaknesses while also activating
your long-term memory.</p>
<p>Finally, to be a successful student and scholar, you will need to
<a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-4/">preserve your notes</a> for later use. You might use a series of organized
folders on your computer or some kind of filing system in manila
folders. Whatever works best for you. Retaining all of this hard work
will be of great importance to you later, particularly as you engage in
large <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-12">research</a> projects. As I describe in the next chapter,
being a scholar&mdash;or just a great student&mdash;involves reusing and re-purposing
prior work and information.</p>

suggests that taking notes by hand, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/">rather than using a computer</a>,
aids memory and improves student performance.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="critical-notes-strategies">Critical notes strategies</h2>
<p>Developing a process for making critical notes is perhaps the most
important new habit you will need to be successful in college. Here are
some strategies or principles that may guide your efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduce</strong>. Use <code>summary</code>, <code>paraphrase</code>, and <code>quotation</code> to
reduce an argument to its bare bones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Engage</strong>. Grapple with the ideas and arguments in the text. Ask
questions and make observations. You should note the argumentative
points that you find yourself strongly agreeing or disagreeing with
and your reasons for doing so. You might see a logical inconsistency
or want the author to provide more evidence for his or her claims.
You might make a note to perform some research on an unfamiliar
word, concept, or event mentioned in the argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protect yourself</strong>. Be scrupulous when you <code>summarize</code> and
<code> paraphrase</code> source materials in your notes by ensuring that you
use your own language and sentence structure. A lazy mistake at this
stage may cost you dearly later if you inadvertently <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-10"><code>plagiarize</code></a>
material. Don&rsquo;t forget to meticulously cite the page numbers of all
the information you include in your notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Save your work.</strong> You will need to <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-4">create a system for organizing and retaining these annotations and notes</a> for
later use. You might use a series of organized folders on your
computer or some kind of filing system in manila folders. Whatever
works best for you.</p>
