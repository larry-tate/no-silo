<p>There is something predatory, cruel even, about a pen suspended over a

<p>In college you will encounter demanding texts of great complexity. You
will be asked to engage these texts critically and to challenge the
thinking and conclusions of others. You will also have to retain an
extraordinary amount of information and recall it later. To thrive in
this environment you will need to develop some new habits and
strategies. The most basic, and most important, of these are a formal
procedure for the <strong>annotation of texts</strong> and the creation of <strong>critical
summary notes</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="annotating-texts">Annotating texts</h2>
<p><code>Analysis</code> requires breaking an <code>argument</code> down into smaller parts so that
you can understand how those parts work together to make the whole. The
best way to begin this process is to annotate texts as you read them by
using a system of symbols and marginal notes made on the document
itself. There is no right or wrong way to mark up a text, but you should
develop a system that you are comfortable with and try to stick with it.
Writing while you read will help you stay focused and read critically.
In fact, I would argue that if you are not writing while you read&mdash;by
putting it into your own words through <code>annotation</code>, <code>summary</code>, <code>paraphrase</code>, and <code>quotation</code>&mdash;then you are not reading critically at all.</p>
<p>Your objective in annotation is to flag the key elements of a piece of
writing&mdash;such as the <code>thesis</code>, argumentative points, and key pieces of
evidence. This kind of work serves two purposes. First, it helps you
maintain a critical focus as you read. Second, it helps you later if the
text must be used for study or your own writing.</p>
<p>During my annotations I always flag a number of things. I underline the
<code>thesis</code> once I find it and I place large dots next to pieces of <code>evidence</code>
or statements being used to support the <code>thesis</code>. I always place keywords
or a short statement next to each <code>paragraph</code>, aiming to create a &ldquo;micro
summary&rdquo; of the content. I use check marks or exclamation points next
to statements that I find important or noteworthy. Sometimes I draw
arrows to connect parts of the essay that seem related to me in some
way.</p>
<p>In addition to flagging and <code>summarizing</code> a text&rsquo;s key ideas and
<code>arguments</code>, I also ask questions in the margins or note places where I
become confused. This is helpful later, on my second reading, since I
can pay more careful attention to the passages that gave me trouble. I
also write my thoughts as they occur to me and state objections to
things that seem problematic or wrongheaded. Sometimes I try to connect
an idea in one text with the idea(s) in another text I have read. Making
these sorts of connections is a central feature of the kind of thinking
and writing you will do in college.</p>
<p>As you can see from the example here to the right, the process of
annotation keeps me engaged, active, and alert&mdash;key components in critical
thinking.</p>

<h2 id="the-false-allure-of-the-highlighter">The false allure of the highlighter</h2>
<p>Students often associate critical thinking and a general studiousness
with the use of a highlighter. However, I&rsquo;d like to question this
practice a bit. Compare the following selection from a student&rsquo;s course
reading to the annotation practices outlined above:</p>
<p><img src="/img/highlighter.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There are a number of problems worth noting here about the practice of
highlighting while reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, your objective when you read something should be <em>to avoid
having to read it again</em> (unless, of course, you would enjoy doing
so). Highlighting important portions of a text, as this student has
done, only signals that the highlighted bits were important to the
reader at the time of the reading. But to discover <em>why</em> they are
important or <em>what</em> the highlighted portions mean, the student will
be forced to read the text again. Busy students studying for
multiple midterms do not have time to re-read entire books or
articles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, highlighting works against critical thinking by casting
the reader in the passive role of information consumer. As <a href="http://libcat.dartmouth.edu/record=6773185">Keith
Hjortshoj argues</a>,
highlighting merely &quot;emphasizes the authority of the text: what its
author says, believes, or knows. The practice therefore leads you
toward memorization and repetition, not toward interpretation,
inquiry, or criticism&quot; (41). While recalling information at a later
time is important, this is not the sole purpose of reading. Critical
reading also involves a process of evaluating, questioning, and
interpreting the text&ndash;activities that highlighting severely limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirdly, highlighting doesn&rsquo;t help you place the information into
your long-term memory. <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/victorp/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf">Recent
research</a>
suggests that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/">taking notes by
hand</a>
results in a significant boost to information retention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, highlighting doesn&rsquo;t help you understand the structure of
an <code>argument</code>&mdash;the main goal of any critical <code>analysis</code>. Arguments all
have a certain structure: there is a main idea supported by a series
of <code>claims</code>, <code>reasons</code>, and pieces of supporting <code>evidence</code>. The
highlighter <em>fails to reveal this structure</em>. Flagging key
structural features of arguments (as described above in the process
of annotation) will dramatically reduce the time it takes to study
and will be of significant help in your writing as you make use of
the texts in question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="annotation-strategies">Annotation strategies</h2>
<p>Since you have likely never engaged a text in such a manner, here are
some strategies that you might consider as you develop a process for
annotation and critical reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a symbol system</strong>. Develop a system of symbols to flag
important aspects of a reading. Mark significant elements within the
text such as the <code>thesis</code>, argumentative <code>claims</code>, and <code>evidence</code>. Also
note when a text references other texts, authors, or events. Note
places where you become confused or uncertain; later, in a second
reading, you can give extra attention to these portions of the text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interrogate the text</strong>. Be ruthless. Be rigorous. Ask questions
back to the author in the margins of the text. Challenge the
conclusions and arguments that he or she presents by making ones of
your own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Summarize</strong>. Write keywords or make &ldquo;microsummaries&rdquo; in the
margins next to each paragraph. Later, you will not have to re-read
the entire document to find your place. These can be especially
useful if you later use this text in your own writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connect</strong>. Find connections between the reading and others within
the course or your broader reading experience. Develop the capacity
to bring other texts into dialogue with each other, imagining
writing and reading as a form of social interaction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
