# Writing 2

**Writing 2** is an introduction to academic writing. The course focuses on how to `acquire knowledge,` `evaluate evidence,` `think critically,` `synthesize information,` and `make effective arguments.` We will cultivate these critical practices through rigorous group `inquiry`--- by reading and analyzing a series of demanding texts and responding to them in the form of essays. Shorter writing assignments and workshops will focus on a number of skills that are important for taking part in academic conversations. Among these are the formal `documentation of sources` and the integration of source materials through `summary,` `paraphrase,` and `quotation.`

#### Purpose of workshops

The purpose of these workshops is largely *diagnostic*; they will not, of themselves, make you a better writer. However, they will help reveal things that you struggle with as a writer. Think of these workshops as tools for self-assessmentâ€”you will use them to gain insight into your own abilities and create a plan for improvement. Significantly, you may revise these workshops as many times as you wish; thus, every student should get 100% on each of these assignments. To me, the grade is not important; what matters is that you become more proficient writers and thinkers.
