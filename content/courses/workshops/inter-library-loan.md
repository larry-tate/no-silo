# Getting sources our library doesn't own

A common problem in academic research is discovering that a book or
article you require for a project is checked out, missing, or not owned
by the library. There are a number of free services available to you
when you encounter this problem.

### Borrow Direct consortium

A number of the best libraries in the world have formed a consortium
designed to share resources and expand research opportunities for the
entire academic community. As students of Dartmouth College, you may
obtain borrowing privileges at any of the other participating libraries
including Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania,
Princeton, Yale and the Center for Research Libraries. The combined
resources total a staggering 50 million volumes.

To see if a book is available at another library, use a service called
[Borrow Direct](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/res-share/borrowdirect/). With
this service you may search every library in the consortium
simultaneously to see if the book you require is available at another
institution. If the book is owned by another school and is not checked
out at the time, you may request that the item be sent to our library.
These requests usually arrive in 4 working days or less.

### DartDoc

If there is a book or article you would like to read that is not
available through Borrow Direct, you may request it from Dartmouth's
interlibrary loan program, known as [DartDoc](https://dartmouth.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/berry/logon.html). To request an item, visit
the DartDoc webpage, select the appropriate form (article, book, book chapter,
etc.), and send your request electronically to the office. Staff will
request your item from another library, who will ship the book to our
library through the mail. If you are requesting a book chapter or
article, the donor library will send you a .pdf free of charge to your
DartDoc account.

[<i class="fas fa-circle"></i>]() If you are ordering a book, DartDoc is the *slowest* of all the
available options for requesting research materials. Requests may take
up to two weeks to be fulfilled.
