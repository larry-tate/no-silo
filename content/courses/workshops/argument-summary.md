# Argument Summary 

---

Write a [**summary**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8) of Nicholson Baker’s argument in “Changes of Mind” that is no more than 250 words.

Include all of Baker’s argumentative claims or assertions. Leave nothing out. Put nothing extra in.
Remain objective: don't tell the audience your opinions or how you feel about Baker's writing or argument. Just give us the facts. 

- Don’t forget to provide [MLA-formatted](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11-mla) citations indicating the page number(s) of the points you summarize.
Use the [*Open Handbook*](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8) for help crafting appropriate signal phrases.

- Work in groups of three to discuss which elements of Baker’s essay should be included within the summary. Use this time to distinguish assertions and claims from examples and metaphors.

- Your work in the [argument analysis workshop](/courses/workshops/argument-analysis) should be very helpful to you. Although you may work with your partners to decide what to include in the summary, please write your own.

## Common questions

*Can I use a quotation in a summary*? 

- Sure, why not? Of course, you need to strike a balance. If you overdo it, the thing you write ceases to be a summary and becomes more like a tissue of quotations. But the judicious use of quotations happens in summary and paraphrases all the time. 

*Can I use no quotations in a summary*? 

- Sure, why not? You may choose to use your own words to explain the ideas of another writer. It is occasionally quite valuable to offer the exact words of another writer. But that is not necessary the case here. The important thing is that you accurately communicate the thinking of another writer under the assigned word count.
