# What should students be able to do?


- **Analysis**. Students should be able to tear arguments down to the studs, revealing a text's purpose, structure, and support. This involves identifying a text's `thesis`, `claims`, `evidence`, `reasons`, and `assumptions`.

- **Active readers**. Students should not be passive consumers of texts, but active and critical interrogators of what they read. They should recognize specious reasoning and rhetorical manipulation.

- **Summary**. Students should be able to accurately re-present the ideas and arguments of other writers *in abbreviated form* to an audience who is unfamiliar with the text using words and sentence structures of their own manufacture.

- **Paraphrase**. Students should be able to accurately re-present the ideas and statements of other writers to an audience who is unfamiliar with the text using words and sentence structures of their own manufacture.

- **Quotation** Students should be able to artfully include the exact words of other writers in their own writing and know when quotation is helpful and appropriate.

- **Critical thinking**. Students should be able to think critically about the arguments presented by other writers, then assess the value of these arguments using arguments and reasons of their own. Students should also be able to bring this same sort of critical analysis described to bear on images, spaces, cultural artifacts, and performances of various sorts.

- **Theoretical analysis**. Students should be able to make use of the arguments made by others by applying these found ideas to new contexts.

- **Evaluate evidence**. Students should be able to critically analyze the evidence used to support arguments, evaluating its suitability and accuracy.

- **Make arguments**. Students should be able to make effective arguments that use claims and evidence to support a main idea.

- **Audience awareness**. Students should be able to think clearly about those people they hope to address and persuade with their arguments and then make appropriate rhetorical choices so as to make their best case.

- **Take part in academic conversations**. Students should be able to enter academic conversations in their writing. This ability encompasses a) academic research skills; b) the proper use of signal phrases, summary, paraphrase, and quotation; c) proper documentation of sources; d) an awareness about what is actually a relevant point of debate.
