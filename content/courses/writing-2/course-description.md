# Writing 2

**Writing 2** is an introduction to academic writing. The course focuses on how to `acquire knowledge,` `evaluate evidence,` `think critically,` `synthesize information,` and `make effective arguments.` We will cultivate these critical practices through rigorous group `inquiry`--- by reading and analyzing a series of demanding texts and responding to them in the form of essays. Shorter writing assignments and workshops will focus on a number of skills that are important for taking part in academic conversations. Among these are the formal `documentation of sources` and the integration of source materials through `summary,` `paraphrase,` and `quotation.`
