## Finding a Book in the Library

Libraries use classification systems to organize their holdings. The most common in the English-speaking world are the [Dewey Decimal Classification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification) (DDC) and the [Library of Congress Classification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification) (LCC) systems. There are a number of other library systems. In Europe, for example, you will encounter the [Universal Decimal Classification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Decimal_Classification) (UDC) system. Like most research libraries in the US, Dartmouth's libraries use the Library of Congress system. 

### The Library of Congress System

The Library of Congress assigns every copyrighted book a unique **call number** consisting of a series of numbers and letters that help you locate them on the library's shelves and indicate the subject matter contained within it. A typical call number will resemble the following:

- `F 24 .T39 1990`

Let's break down the call number into its constituent parts:

| Call Number  |  Name | Purpose or Use      
|:----------|:-------------|:---------|
| **F** |  Letter line | <ul><li>Indicates subject matter or discipline of the book and the [section of the library](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/bakerberry/circ/stacksguides/) where the book is shelved.</li><li>You can examine the [full list of subject classes](https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/) at the Library of Congress.</li></ul> 
| **24** |  Whole number line | <ul><li>Indicates a narrower subtopic within a discipline or subject.</li><li>Tells you which *row* the book is on in the stacks.</li></ul>
| **.T39** |  Cutter line | <ul><li>Identifies the individual book.</li><li>The first letter of the Cutter line is usually the first letter of the author’s last name.</li></ul>
| **1990** | Edition/Date line | <ul><li>Tells you the book’s year of publication.</li><li>May also include volume or edition information.</li></ul>

### Steps to find a book on the shelf

{{< details "Step 1: Letter Line" closed >}}

# `F` 24 .T39 1990

Using the **letter line**, determine the floor of the library where the book is shelved. The library's [floorplan maps](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/bakerberry/circ/stacksguides/) will help you locate the proper section. Using our example call number above, we can determine that the **F** section is in `Stack Level A`.

{{< details "Step 2: Whole Number Line" closed >}} 

#

# F `24` .T39 1990

Once on the appropriate floor, use the **whole number line** to find the
row where the book is shelved in the stacks. Using the example call
number, we will look through the stacks for the number `24`. Each library floor has a [floormaps](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/bakerberry/circ/stacksguides/) to help guide you; they are available in .pdf form or are posted on the wall of each floor, near the entrance. 

As you walk through the stacks, look on the ends of each row for signs describing the range of books held within the row such as the one below:
<div style="text-align:center">{{< figure src="/img/stacks.jpg" >}}

{ *Use these signs to determine if a book is in the row*. }</div>

Since `F 24` is within this range, our example book is in that row. Once in the proper row of shelves, proceed numerically until you find the `24`s.

{{< details "Step 3: Cutter Line" closed >}} 

#

# F 24 `.T39` 1990

Finally, using the `Cutter line,` proceed alphabetically until you hit the Ts. Then proceed numerically until you find `.T39`, the address of our book.

* The date or volume information at the end of a call number will only be useful to you if you are looking for a particular edition of a book.

{{< /details >}}

As you can see, the call number should be read from left to right using alphabetical and numerical orders. Thus, a book with a Subject line `F` would be shelved *before* a book with a Subject line `FA.`
Similarly, a Cutter line that reads `.T39` is shelved *after* `.T21`.

Maps of the library's floorplans are affixed to the walls on each floor. Free paper maps of the library are available at the circulation desk of the library. You may also consult the [maps and floorplans](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/bakerberry/circ/stacksguides/) online with your computer or smartphone.


### Or, just forget all of that

A new update to Dartmouth's catalog as of 2014 allows you to simply click the "map it" button next to the item's listing in the catalog. 

[<div style="text-align:center">{{< figure src="/img/mapit.png" >}}</div>](https://search.library.dartmouth.edu/permalink/01DCL_INST/16rgcn8/alma991031290259705706)

Clicking this button will summon a map that shows you the approximate location of the book in the
library stacks.
