# No Silo

This is the repo containing the files to generate the [No Silo](https://no-silo.com) site, made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

`No Silo` is the companion site to Alan C. Taylorâ€™s courses at Dartmouth College. The site contains syllabi, course materials, workshops, the [Open Handbook](https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/) project, and other related bits and pieces.
