# Introduction

Here is some shit about me and the class and the fucking pandemic shit we are facing. Writing is just goddamn hard. And it is much harder when you are alone and can't connect with others to give you help. Email and Zoom are pretty fucking terrible substitutes. But, what are you gonna do? No way but through. With a mask.

**I hate this too.**

This pandemic is bullshit. I'm not happy. You're not happy. Let's just try to use this time to prepare for the kinds of writing and research that you'll want to do here at Dartmouth. When you start feeling sorry for yourself, just imagine being stuck in a house with a 5 year-old and a 2 year-old. *Welcome to my hell*.

# Relating to your professors

One of the most difficult things to navigate at college is how to relate to your instructors. Here are a few marginally helpful things that may help you keep a good relationship with your teachers.

## Tactical Errors

#

Asking your professor to meet and discuss your idea(s) for a project shortly before it is due reveals that you haven't started yet. There is a certain cutoff point after which you should not reveal such things to the person who will grade your work. While it is quite possible for a good student to write something amazing overnight, revealing this to your professor may not be to your advantage.

`Did I miss anything?`

This is one of the most annoying questions professors hear. Never ask your professor if you "missed anything important" on a day you were absent. Yes, yes you did. It is all important. (And even if it's not, pretend that it is).

## The Course Sequence

Writing 2-3 is an introduction to academic writing and research. The overarching objective of this course is to prepare you for the rigors of the academic life. To succeed in a scholarly environment we must develop good habits of inquiry, analysis, and communication. We will cultivate these critical practices through rigorous group inquiryâ€”by reading and analyzing a series of demanding texts and articulating responses to them in the form of essays. Shorter writing assignments will focus on a number of skills that are important for taking part in academic conversations. Among these are the formal documentation of sources and the integration of source materials through summary, paraphrase, and quotation.

During the Winter term we will turn our focus to academic research. Our libraries have an impressive array of traditional and electronic search tools as well as millions of books, journal articles, and assorted media. Although navigating this vast sea of information is intimidating, it is important that you find your way: excellent research skills are fundamental to your undergraduate training, regardless of your chosen field of study. In consideration of its importance, we will spend a significant amount of time learning how to use our library effectively.

A more detailed description of the course objectives and outcomes may be found in the [Writing 2/3 Course Outcomes]() statement on the Institute for Writing and Rhetoric website.
