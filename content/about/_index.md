# About Me


{{< figure src="/img/me.jpg" >}}

I grew up on a mountain swallowed up by [kudzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudzu) just across the river from Chattanooga, Tennessee.  

Most of my schooling was spent studying nineteenth-century American literature, culture, and history. I'm mostly interested in backcountry settlements in the early republic and conflicts between Native peoples and settlers. Some of my writing examines the significance of the US [Land Survey Ordinance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System)---a sprawling national project that divided huge portions of North America into a vast grid of private property. Surveying, it turns out, was a critical technology for national expansion and Indian removal. I'm working on a book as I have time that is provisionally titled `Empire of Paper`.   

I'm also very interested in open-source software and culture. I'm a fan of Canonical's [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) and System 76's [Pop OS](https://pop.system76.com/) and am amazed at the generosity of the open-source community. I'm particularly enthused by the [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) projects. 

When there is no pandemic about, I follow the Boston Red Sox and the Tennessee Volunteers football team. 

I'm a mildly accomplished computer nerd. 

I have two adorable little kids who never let me get a full night's sleep but are nevertheless the keepers of my whole heart.
