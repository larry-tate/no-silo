# Quarterly Reflection and Review

This assignment asks you to reflect on your work this term. This work should be completed after you return home for the break, but before we begin our second term this winter. Your responses to the questions below will be used in a conference during the first week of term. 

## Step 1: Take inventory

To begin, gather all of your written work for the term (you have been [saving all your work](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-4/), right?) Re-read the drafts for each of the main essay assignments in order, from first draft to final draft. Take time to notice how the pieces evolved due to your own process of revision and in response to the commentary you received from your professor and fellow students.

In response to this reflection, write down answers to the following questions for each of your three main essay assignments:

1. How did your essay change from first draft to final form?
2. What was particularly strong about this revised, final version?
3. What things could you still improve in this final draft? 
4. What were you particularly proud of in the final draft?
4. Considering the whole process, what did you learn from writing this particular essay?


## Step 2: Learning

1. What have you learned through the experience of the class?
2. Was there something you expected to learn, but didn't?
3. Are there specific things you would like to work on in the winter term?


## Step 3: Participation

1. How many classes or TA sessions did you miss?
2. How actively engaged were you in the class? 
3. Did you turn in all the assignments?
4. Were all the assignments turned in on time?
5. Did you give your best effort on each assignment?
6. Expressed as a percentage, how much of the reading did you do?
7. How much did you contribute to Hive? Was this your best effort at sharing/helping others?
8. How often did you speak up in discussion sections? Could you have contributed more to the discussion?

## Step 5: Final grade

After now reflecting on the entirety of your performance this term, what final grade would you suggest for yourself?
