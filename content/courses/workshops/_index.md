# Workshops and Lectures

This term we will do a series of workshops designed to learn and practice various skills needed for academic writing and research. 

The purpose of these workshops is often largely diagnostic; they will not, of themselves, make you a better writer. However, they will help reveal things that you struggle with as a writer and alert you to things you don't yet know. Think of them as tools for learning and self-assessment---you may use them to gain insight into your own abilities and create a plan for improvement.
