      <description>What should students be able to do?   Analysis. Students should be able to tear arguments down to the studs, revealing a text&amp;rsquo;s purpose, structure, and support. This involves identifying a text&amp;rsquo;s thesis, claims, evidence, reasons, and assumptions.
  Active readers. Students should not be passive consumers of texts, but active and critical interrogators of what they read. They should recognize specious reasoning and rhetorical manipulation.
  Summary.</description>

      <description>Introduction Here is some shit about me and the class and the fucking pandemic shit we are facing. Writing is just goddamn hard. And it is much harder when you are alone and can&amp;rsquo;t connect with others to give you help. Email and Zoom are pretty fucking terrible substitutes. But, what are you gonna do? No way but through. With a mask.
I hate this too.
This pandemic is bullshit. I&amp;rsquo;m not happy.</description>
