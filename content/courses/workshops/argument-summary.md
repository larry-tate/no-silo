# 2. Argument Summary Workshop

Write a [summary](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8) of Nicholson Baker’s argument in “Changes of Mind” that is no more than 250 words.

Include all of Baker’s argumentative claims or assertions. Leave nothing out. Put nothing extra in.
Remain objective. Do not tell the audience your opinions or how you feel about Baker's writing or argument. Just give us the facts. 

- Don’t forget to provide [MLA-formatted](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11-mla) citations indicating the page number(s) of the points you summarize.
Use the [Open Handbook](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8) for help crafting appropriate signal phrases.

- Work in groups of three to discuss which elements of Baker’s essay should be included within the summary. Use this time to distinguish assertions and claims from examples and metaphors.

- Feel free to use your work from the [argument analysis workshop](/courses/workshops/argument-analysis), which should be helpful (if you did them well). Although you may work with your partners to decide what to include in the summary, please write your own.
