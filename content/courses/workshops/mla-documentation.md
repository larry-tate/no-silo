# Documentation, Paraphrase, Summary

Accurately documenting sources is a vital aspect of any process of inquiry. If you fail to properly document your sources, your readers will be unable to follow your research, validate your claims, or judge the quality of your argument. Furthermore, failing to cite a source (whether summarized, paraphrased or quoted) opens you to the charge of plagiarism, a serious academic offense. With this in mind, it is vital that you become acquainted with how to document sources in your writing. 

However, quoting materials from a source is often not a straightforward or easy task. Sometimes you must alter the original source in some way to serve a variety of rhetorical needs. You might want to cut out a part of a quotation that is irrelevant to your particular focus; or, you might find it necessary to omit a particular word or words to help you satisfy grammar. At the same time, you may need to add or change something to a text in order to provide clarifying information or to satisfy grammar or capitalization rules.

How do you do these things? 

Completing this exercise will not make you an ace at citation, altering sources, or paraphrase. But it will expose several things that you don't yet know how to do and where to find help with those things. Follow the directions below and use the quoted text as your source. 

- The following quotation comes from page 47 of Walker Percy's essay, “The Loss of the Creature”:

>Why is it almost impossible to gaze directly at the Grand Canyon under these circumstances and see it for what it is—as one picks up a strange object from one's back yard and gazes directly at it? It is almost impossible because the Grand Canyon, the thing as it is, has been appropriated by the symbolic complex which has already been formed in the sightseer's mind. Seeing the canyon under approved circumstances is seeing the symbolic complex head on. The thing is no longer the thing as it confronted the Spaniard; it is rather that which has already been formulated—by picture postcard, geography book, tourist folders, and the words Grand Canyon. As a result of this preformulation, the source of the sightseer's pleasure undergoes a shift. Where the wonder and delight of the Spaniard arose from his penetration of the thing itself, from a progressive discovery of depths, patterns, colors, shadows, etc., now the sightseer measures his satisfaction by the degree to which the canyon conforms to the preformed complex.


## Section I

1. Use a signal phrase with the author’s name to introduce a quotation from this text and then cite according to MLA.
2. Use a signal phrase *without* the author's name to introduce a quotation and then cite according to MLA. 
3. Use a signal phrase with the author’s name, *summarize* this entire passage in your own words, and then cite according to MLA. 
4. Summarize this entire passage in your own words without using the author’s name and then cite according to MLA. 

## Section II


1. Write a sentence involving a quotation from the from the passage using *ellipsis* to show an omission, then cite according to MLA. The ellipsis must be for an omission in the middle of a sentence. 
2. Quote a portion of this passage using ellipsis to show an omission, then cite according to MLA. The ellipsis must remove the ending of one sentence and the beginning of another. 
3. Use square *brackets* in a quotation to give the reader clarifying information, then cite according to MLA. 
4. Quote from this passage using the block quote format, then cite according to MLA.


## Section III

Write a complete paraphrase of this text. Think of paraphrase as a translation from English into English—express the same ideas as another writer but use your own words and sentence structure. Cite in MLA accordingly.


## Section IV

Rewrite your paraphrase, but this time integrate some of the author’s language (in the form of short quotations) that you feel is significant or memorable. Cite in MLA accordingly.
