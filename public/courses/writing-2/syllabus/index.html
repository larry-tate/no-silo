<h1 id="writing-2">Writing 2</h1>
<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p><strong>Writing 2</strong> is an introduction to academic writing and research. The course prepares you for work in a scholarly environment where you will be expected to engage in inquiry, perform analysis, and communicate clearly. We will cultivate these critical practices by reading and analyzing a series of demanding texts and articulating responses to them in the form of essays. Shorter writing assignments will focus on a number of skills that are important for taking part in academic conversations. Among these are the formal <code>documentation of sources</code> and the integration of source materials through <code>summary</code>, <code>paraphrase</code>, and <code>quotation</code>.</p>
<p>During the Winter term we will turn our focus to academic research. Our
libraries hold an impressive array of traditional and electronic search
tools as well as millions of books, journal articles, and assorted
media. Although navigating this vast sea of information is intimidating,
it is important that you find your way: excellent research skills are
fundamental to your undergraduate training, regardless of your chosen
field of study. In consideration of its importance, we will spend a
significant amount of time learning how to use our library effectively.</p>

<h2 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>All work submitted in this course must be your own and be written
exclusively for this course. The use of sources (ideas, quotations,
paraphrase) must be properly documented. Please read the <a href="https://students.dartmouth.edu/judicial-affairs/policy/academic-honor-principle">Academic Honor
Principle</a> for more information about the dire consequences of plagiarism. If you are confused about when or how to cite information, please consult the course handbook or ask me about it before submitting your work.</p>
<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
<p>Regular attendance is expected. Bracketing religious observance, severe
illness, or personal tragedy, <strong>no more than three unexcused absences</strong> in a
single term will be acceptable for this course. <em>This policy applies to
regular class meetings, assigned X hours, and TA meetings</em>. Four or more
unexcused absences may result in repercussions ranging from significant
reduction in GPA to failure of the course. If you have a religious
observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please
meet with me beforehand to discuss appropriate accommodations.</p>
<h2 id="papers">Papers</h2>
<p>You will submit three formal essays and several smaller writing
assignments in response to our readings and class discussions. The
formal essays focus on argumentation, synthesis, close reading, and
theoretical analysis. The exact nature and objective of each assignment
will be explained in greater detail throughout the course of the term.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Formatting</strong>: During the fall term papers must be submitted in the
<a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11-mla">MLA style</a>; in the winter term we will transition to the <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11-chi">Chicago
style</a>. Information on these styles may be found in the <em>Open Handbook</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Late Papers</strong>: Late papers will receive <em>a full letter grade
deduction</em> for each day late.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revisions</strong>: It is my practice to return essay drafts to you
within one week. Afterward, you will have a minimum of one week to
revise your writing. During this two-week revision cycle, I am happy
to look at your drafts at any stage of development. Please feel free
to meet with me during office hours (or by appointment) to go over
your writing or discuss your ideas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reading-thinking-discussing-reflecting-writing">Reading, Thinking, Discussing, Reflecting, Writing</h2>
<p>Here is a list of the typical assignments and activities that we will do each week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before we meet to discuss a reading as a class, each of you will carefully read and critically engage the text on your own&mdash;interrogating, analyzing, and questioning the arguments, ideas, and assumptions you discover there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you read, I ask that you <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-1/">annotate</a> the text&mdash;that is, mark up
the text by adding meaningful symbols, marginal notes, and questions
on the document itself. Bring this annotated copy of the reading
with you to class to help you engage in the group discussion and
analysis. <em>This requires that you print out the text before you begin reading it.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After annotating the text, take <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-2/">critical notes</a> on the text in a separate document. These notes will be valuable to you later, when you write your essays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After annotating and taking notes, contribute to <a href="/resources/hive">Hive</a>, our open-source repository of notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following three numbered sections explain each of these assignments in more detail:</p>
<h3 id="1-annotating-texts">1) Annotating Texts</h3>
<p>Rather than use a laptop or tablet to read our course readings, <em>I ask
that you print them out and annotate them as part of your preparations
for class</em>. Annotation refers to the process of marking up a text by
adding your own words and symbols to the document itself. There is no
right or wrong way to mark up a text, but you should develop a system
that you are comfortable with and try to stick with it. Your objective
in annotation is to flag the key elements of a piece of writing&mdash;the
thesis, argumentative points, and pieces of evidence. In addition, use
the margins of the text to ask questions, make brief notes, indicate
confusion, define unfamiliar terms, and make connections to other texts.
This kind of work serves two purposes: first, it helps you maintain a
critical focus as you read; second, it helps you later if the text must
be used for study or your own writing. If you plan on being successful
in college, the ability to rigorously annotate texts is perhaps the most
helpful and important skill you can develop. Further advice and caveats
about annotation may be found in the <a href="https://github.com/stockphrase/OpenHandbook/raw/master/Open%20Handbook.pdf"><em>Open Handbook</em></a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-critical-reading-notes">2) Critical Reading Notes</h3>
<p>Create an electronic document for composing critical notes. Take
<em>detailed</em> notes on each reading. Since you will write essays about
these texts, these notes will be of significant help to you later. Your
aim here should be to <em>reduce the entire argument to its bare essentials
using paraphrase, summary, and selective quotation</em>. Carefully document
page numbers during this activity. Interrogate the text by asking
questions, raising objections, and making observations. Connect and
compare the reading to others we have read. Link to any outside research
you perform and define unfamiliar terms or words. At the end of this
process you should have a simplified version of the essay as well as a
number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that emerged in
the process of reading.</p>
<ul>
<li>For more detailed information on the creation and purpose of these
notes, read the chapters entitled &ldquo;Annotation &amp; Critical Reading&rdquo;
and &quot;Critical Notes&quot; in the <a href="https://github.com/stockphrase/OpenHandbook/raw/master/Open%20Handbook.pdf"><em>Open
Handbook</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-contribute-to-hive">3) Contribute to Hive</h3>
<p>Hive is an open-source repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings and class discussions. We will build this resource together as a class&mdash;sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course readings we encounter. The “hive mind” is capable of discovering and uncovering far more than any one individual. With luck, Hive will become a central resource in our class discussions and an indispensable aid to you as you craft your essays.</p>
<p>You might contribute to Hive by doing some of the following tasks:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Help create a simplified version of the text’s argumentative structure by presenting an ordered list of claims, reasons, and evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask a question about a difficult passage in the text or offer an answer to one posed by another student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define difficult vocabulary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quote a portion of the essay that seems worthy of discussion or analysis and explain why it seems significant, or build on the thought of another student who has done so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a connection between an idea found in one text with others we have read in class (or elsewhere).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constructively question, respond, or correct the ideas or work of another student.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many sources of help for your writing assignments. I am happy
to meet with you all term during my office hours or by appointment. Each
of you will meet with our TA for 45 minutes per week to go over your
writing and plan revision. If you require further help, the
