## Writing 3

**Writing 3** focuses on academic `research`. Our libraries have an impressive array of traditional and electronic search tools as well as millions of books, journal articles, and assorted media. Although navigating this vast sea of information is intimidating, it is important that you find your way: excellent research skills are fundamental to your undergraduate training, regardless of your chosen field of study. In consideration of its importance, we will spend a significant amount of time learning how to use our library effectively. 

The theme for this course is `post-apocalyptic` fiction, film, and art.

#### Purpose of workshops

The purpose of these workshops is largely *diagnostic*; they will not, of themselves, make you a better writer. However, they will help reveal things that you struggle with as a writer. Think of these workshops as tools for self-assessmentâ€”you will use them to gain insight into your own abilities and create a plan for improvement. Significantly, you may revise these workshops as many times as you wish; thus, every student should get 100% on each of these assignments. To me, the grade is not important; what matters is that you become more proficient writers and thinkers.
