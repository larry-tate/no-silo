# Using this Text

Throughout this text I've highlighted important `academic keywords`. There are three types of these highlights in the text, described in the table below:

## Highlighting & Link Styling

| Keyword   |      Link Style | Note    
|----------|:-------------:|---------|
| Academic keyword |  `text` | A term you should know as a college student.
| An *internal* link | [`text`]() | A topic covered elsewhere in this text.
| An *external* link |  [text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0) | A link to a resource outside this text.
