      <description>Writing 2  Writing 2 is an introduction to academic writing. The course focuses on how to acquire knowledge, evaluate evidence, think critically, synthesize information, and make effective arguments. We will cultivate these critical practices through rigorous group inquiry&amp;mdash; by reading and analyzing a series of demanding texts and responding to them in the form of essays. Shorter writing assignments and workshops will focus on a number of skills that are important for taking part in academic conversations.</description>
