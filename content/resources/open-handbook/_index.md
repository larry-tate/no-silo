# About

[{{< fa book-open >}}](#) `The Open Handbook` 
        

The `Open Handbook` project is a free, open-source reference handbook that introduces students to the conventions of academic writing and research. The project was originally written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and hosted at {{< fa code-branch >}} [GitHub](https://github.com/stockphrase/OpenHandbook). I am in the process of translating the project into [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files so that I can include it on this website. The chapters will slowly appear here on this site as I have time.
