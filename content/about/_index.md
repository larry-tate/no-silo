I grew up on a mountain swallowed up by [kudzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudzu) just across the river from Chattanooga, Tennessee.  

In college and graduate school I studied nineteenth-century American literature, culture, and history. I'm interested in backcountry settlements in the early republic and conflicts between Native peoples and settlers. I've written about the significance of the US [Land Survey Ordinance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System)---a sprawling national project that divided huge portions of North America into a vast grid of private property. Surveying, it turns out, was a critical technology for national expansion. I'm working on a book as I have time that is provisionally titled `Empire of Paper.`

I'm also very interested in open-source software and culture. I'm a fan of Canonical's [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) and System 76's [Pop OS](https://pop.system76.com/) and am amazed at the generosity of the open-source community. I'm particularly enthused by the [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) projects. 

When there is no pandemic about, I follow the Boston Red Sox and the Tennessee Volunteers football team. 

I'm a mildly accomplished computer nerd. 

I have two adorable little kids who never let me get a full night's sleep but are nevertheless the keepers of my whole heart.
