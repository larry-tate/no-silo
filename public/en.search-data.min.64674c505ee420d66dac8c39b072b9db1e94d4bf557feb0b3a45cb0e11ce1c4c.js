These reference texts introduce students to the conventions of academic writing and often include chapters on academic research, critical thinking, grammar, and formal citation.\nThe knowledge contained in these texts is indispensable. However, most handbooks on the market today are bloated in both content and price (I think the former is often the justification for the latter). For example, the institution where I formerly worked required students to purchase a handbook that was over 900 pages long and cost around $60. I think that is too long and too much.\nMy goal for this project is to create a brief handbook with everything students need to successfully navigate their college writing assignments, then give it away for free.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re welcome!\nAlan C.

The course prepares you for work in a scholarly environment where you will require good habits of inquiry, analysis, and communication. We will cultivate these critical practices by reading and analyzing a series of demanding texts and articulating responses to them in the form of essays. Shorter writing assignments will focus on a number of skills that are important for taking part in academic conversations. Among these are the formal documentation of sources and the integration of source materials through summary, paraphrase, and quotation.\nDuring the Winter term we will turn our focus to academic research. Our libraries hold an impressive array of traditional and electronic search tools as well as millions of books, journal articles, and assorted media. Although navigating this vast sea of information is intimidating, it is important that you find your way: excellent research skills are fundamental to your undergraduate training, regardless of your chosen field of study. In consideration of its importance, we will spend a significant amount of time learning how to use our library effectively.\n A more detailed description of the course objectives and outcomes may be found in the Writing 2/3 Course Outcomes statement on the Institute for Writing and Rhetoric website.  Required Texts  The Open Handbook (.pdf), Open Handbook (web), by Alan C. Taylor Other course readings may be downloaded from Canvas.  Academic Honesty All work submitted in this course must be your own and be written exclusively for this course. The use of sources (ideas, quotations, paraphrase) must be properly documented. Please read the Academic Honor Principle for more information about the dire consequences of plagiarism. If you are confused about when or how to cite information, please consult the course handbook or ask me about it before submitting your work.\nAttendance Regular attendance is expected. Bracketing religious observance, severe illness, or personal tragedy, no more than three unexcused absences in a single term will be acceptable for this course. This policy applies to regular class meetings, assigned X hours, and TA meetings. Four or more unexcused absences may result in repercussions ranging from significant reduction in GPA to failure of the course. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me beforehand to discuss appropriate accommodations.\nPapers You will submit three formal essays and several smaller writing assignments in response to our readings and class discussions. The formal essays focus on argumentation, synthesis, close reading, and theoretical analysis. The exact nature and objective of each assignment will be explained in greater detail throughout the course of the term.\n  Formatting: During the Fall term papers must be submitted in the MLA format; in the Winter term we will transition to the Chicago style. Information on these styles may be found in your handbooks.\n  Late Papers: Late papers will receive a full letter grade deduction for each day late.\n  Revisions: It is my practice to return essay drafts to you within one week. Afterward, you will have a minimum of one week to revise your writing. During this two-week revision cycle, I am happy to look at your drafts at any stage of development. Please feel free to meet with me during office hours (or by appointment) to go over your writing or discuss your ideas.\n  Reading, Thinking, Discussing, Reflecting, Writing Each week of this course follows a relatively predictable pattern. Mondays and Wednesdays are discussion days, where we commonly examine a reading together in class; Fridays are workshop days, where we learn and practice certain critical skills that are used in academic writing and conversations. Here is a list of the typical assignments and activities that we will do each week:\n  Before we meet to discuss a reading as a class, each of you will carefully read and critically engage the text on your own\u0026mdash;interrogating, analyzing, and questioning the arguments, ideas, and assumptions you discover there.\n  As you read the text, I ask that you annotate it\u0026mdash;that is, mark up the text by adding meaningful symbols, marginal notes, and questions on the document itself. Bring this annotated copy of the reading with you to class to help you engage in the group discussion and analysis.\n  After annotating the text, take critical notes on it. These notes will be invaluable to you later, when you write your essays.\n  After annotating and taking notes, post a critical response to the text on the discussion forum in Canvas. Attach your critical notes to the response post you submit in Canvas.\n  Finally, write a reflective journal entry each week that catalogs your thoughts and ideas for the week.\n  The following four numbered sections explain each of these assignments in more detail:\n1) Annotating Texts Rather than use a laptop or tablet to read our course readings, I ask that you print them out and annotate them as part of your preparations for class. Annotation refers to the process of marking up a text by adding your own words and symbols to the document itself. There is no right or wrong way to mark up a text, but you should develop a system that you are comfortable with and try to stick with it. Your objective in annotation is to flag the key elements of a piece of writing\u0026mdash;the thesis, argumentative points, and pieces of evidence. In addition, use the margins of the text to ask questions, make brief notes, indicate confusion, define unfamiliar terms, and make connections to other texts. This kind of work serves two purposes: first, it helps you maintain a critical focus as you read; second, it helps you later if the text must be used for study or your own writing. If you plan on being successful in college, the ability to rigorously annotate texts is perhaps the most helpful and important skill you can develop. Further advice and caveats about annotation may be found in the Open Handbook.\n2) Critical Reading Notes Create an electronic document for composing critical notes. Take detailed notes on each reading. Since you will write essays about these texts, these notes will be of significant help to you later. Your aim here should be to reduce the entire argument to its bare essentials using paraphrase, summary, and selective quotation. Carefully document page numbers during this activity. Interrogate the text by asking questions, raising objections, and making observations. Connect and compare the reading to others we have read. Link to any outside research you perform and define unfamiliar terms or words. At the end of this process you should have a simplified version of the essay as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that emerged in the process of reading.\n For more detailed information on the creation and purpose of these notes, read the chapters entitled \u0026ldquo;Annotation \u0026amp; Critical Reading\u0026rdquo; and \u0026quot;Critical Notes\u0026quot; in the Open Handbook.  3) Reading Response Posts Before we meet to discuss a new course text, write a critical response and post it to our online discussion forum in Canvas. The post should discuss ideas, arguments, or questions that arise from the reading(s). These are writing and thinking exercises, not polished essays; however, I do expect that your posts will grapple with the readings in an intelligent way and demonstrate a great deal of thought and care. Here are some principles to consider as you craft your posts:\n  Good posts do not merely summarize; rather, they should seek to evaluate and engage the writer\u0026rsquo;s claims or ideas. Use your posts to try to come to grips with the reading\u0026rsquo;s ideas (or some aspect of them).\n  Good posts may seek to take issue with some of the thinking put forth in the reading. However, a good post doesn\u0026rsquo;t just say \u0026quot;I agree with X\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;I disagree with Y.\u0026quot; Instead, explicit reasons are stated and explanations are made that challenge or support the writer\u0026rsquo;s ideas. As you will discover, part of this class involves learning to take responsibility for your claims and arguments. This can only be done by providing reasons for the views you hold.\n  Good posts might alternatively attempt to forge a connection with another reading by demonstrating a relationship between the ideas or arguments involved. For example, how might Author A respond to Author B? How do their views compare? Can their views be reconciled? Be specific. Show evidence.\n  Good posts may ask questions or express confusion. Ignorance or confusion is not something to be feared. As Henry David Thoreau once argued, ignorance is often more useful than positive knowledge: confusion generates questions; questions inspire inquiry; inquiry produces knowledge and more interesting questions. Although you are free to pose questions in your posts, you should also make good efforts to answer them. Questions exist to drive us toward answers, not leave us spinning our wheels.\n  Good posts are not sloppy and demonstrate a high degree of care.\n  Good posts avoid narcissism. Don\u0026rsquo;t make everything about you or something that happened to you. While you will of course draw on your own experiences, your focus should be on the text(s).\n  Good posts are not derivative. By this I mean that your post should be original and not a parasite clinging to the work of other students. Demand that everyone contribute their unique and individual perspective to our discourse community. Posts that clearly derive their very lifeblood from other posts should be met with hostility by the class. One way to avoid this problem is to post your response before reading the work of others. This does not mean that you should avoid responding to the thoughts of your colleagues. You should feel free to disagree or question the ideas of others (including your professor). This behavior is actually healthy for our discourse community.\n  4) End-of-Week Journal Reflection Create an electronic document for use as a journal. By Friday each week, compose a reflective post in that document that looks back over the week\u0026rsquo;s reading and discussions. What is your big takeaway for this week? What was the most meaningful thing you heard, thought, or read? It is perfectly fine if your entry deals with things other than this course. Write as much as you like, but submit at least a half a page. We\u0026rsquo;ll often talk about these on Fridays and I may periodically ask to you to turn them in.\nTypical Weekly Workflow and Checklist   Locate the new reading for the upcoming week in Canvas. Download it. Print it out.\n  Read it carefully. Slow down. Unplug. Take your time.\n  Annotate as you read: make notations, flag important details, ask questions.\n  Practice deep note-taking. Reduce the argument to its essentials. Add your own thoughts/observations/questions.\n  On the night before a new reading is due to be discussed, post a reading response to Canvas and attach your critical notes file to it.\n  Before class on Friday, write a reflective journal entry that takes stock of the week.\n  ePortfolios A large body of academic research indicates that students who curate their academic performances over time and periodically revisit them experience measurable benefits in learning and development. For this reason, the DartWrite program provides every incoming student with a WordPress blog for use as an ePortfolio. This portfolio is yours. You own it. You may design it in any way you choose. You may post anything you like thereyour writing, photography, reflections, whatever. We will talk more throughout the term about these ePortfolios and how they may be used. To access your ePortfolio, visit the login page at journeys.dartmouth.edu. Use your NetID credentials to log in.\nComputer Policy I ask that you do not use laptops or tablets in class to take notes or reference the course readings. If you require some kind of technological accommodation that runs counter to this policy, please discuss this with me as soon as possible.\nHelp With Your Writing There are many sources of help for your writing assignments. I am happy to meet with you all term during my office hours or by appointment. Each of you will meet with your TA for 45 minutes per week to go over your writing and plan revision. If you require further help, the RWIT program offers excellent peer tutoring on all phases of the writing processfrom generating ideas to formal citation.\nStudents With Disabilities All students are entitled to full access to this course, regardless of disability. If you have a disability and anticipate needing accommodations in this course, please contact me as soon as possible to arrange a confidential meeting. Students requiring disability-related services must register with the Student Accessibility Services office. Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to me. As a first step, if you have questions about whether you qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, you should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.\nGrading Breakdown The following assignments comprise your grade for the Fall term:\n   Assignment Percentage     Essay One 20%   Essay Two 30%   Essay Three 30%   Workshops 10%   Online Posts 10%    Schedule of Readings and Assignments Week One:\n10.1.20 Week One\n  QOD: Tell me something you love.

Annotation \u0026 Critical Reading",'content':"   Annotation and Critical Reading  There is something predatory, cruel even, about a pen suspended over a text. Like a hawk over a field, it is on the lookout for something vulnerable. Then it is a pleasure to swoop and skewer the victim with the nib\u0026rsquo;s sharp point. The mere fact of holding the hand poised for action changes our attitude to the text. We are no longer passive consumers of a monologue but active participants in a dialogue.\nTim Parks, \u0026quot;A Weapon for Readers\u0026quot;\n In college you will encounter demanding texts of great complexity. You will be asked to engage these texts critically and to challenge the thinking and conclusions of others. You will also have to retain an extraordinary amount of information and recall it later. To thrive in this environment you will need to develop some new habits and strategies. The most basic, and most important, of these are a formal procedure for the annotation of texts and the creation of critical summary notes.\nAnnotating texts Analysis requires breaking an argument down into smaller parts so that you can understand how those parts work together to make the whole. The best way to begin this process is to annotate texts as you read them by using a system of symbols and marginal notes made on the document itself. There is no right or wrong way to mark up a text, but you should develop a system that you are comfortable with and try to stick with it. Writing while you read will help you stay focused and read critically. In fact, I would argue that if you are not writing while you read\u0026mdash;by putting it into your own words through annotation, summary, paraphrase, and quotation\u0026mdash;then you are not reading critically at all.\nYour objective in annotation is to flag the key elements of a piece of writing\u0026mdash;such as the thesis, argumentative points, and key pieces of evidence. This kind of work serves two purposes. First, it helps you maintain a critical focus as you read. Second, it helps you later if the text must be used for study or your own writing.\nDuring my annotations I always flag a number of things. I underline the thesis once I find it and I place large dots next to pieces of evidence or statements being used to support the thesis. I always place keywords or a short statement next to each paragraph, aiming to create a \u0026ldquo;micro summary\u0026rdquo; of the content. I use check marks or exclamation points next to statements that I find important or noteworthy. Sometimes I draw arrows to connect parts of the essay that seem related to me in some way.\nIn addition to flagging and summarizing a text\u0026rsquo;s key ideas and arguments, I also ask questions in the margins or note places where I become confused. This is helpful later, on my second reading, since I can pay more careful attention to the passages that gave me trouble. I also write my thoughts as they occur to me and state objections to things that seem problematic or wrongheaded. Sometimes I try to connect an idea in one text with the idea(s) in another text I have read. Making these sorts of connections is a central feature of the kind of thinking and writing you will do in college.\nAs you can see from the example here to the right, the process of annotation keeps me engaged, active, and alert\u0026mdash;key components in critical thinking.\nThe false allure of the highlighter Students often associate critical thinking and a general studiousness with the use of a highlighter. However, I\u0026rsquo;d like to question this practice a bit. Compare the following selection from a student\u0026rsquo;s course reading to the annotation practices outlined above:\nThere are a number of problems worth noting here about the practice of highlighting while reading:\n  First, your objective when you read something should be to avoid having to read it again (unless, of course, you would enjoy doing so). Highlighting important portions of a text, as this student has done, only signals that the highlighted bits were important to the reader at the time of the reading. But to discover why they are important or what the highlighted portions mean, the student will be forced to read the text again. Busy students studying for multiple midterms do not have time to re-read entire books or articles.\n  Secondly, highlighting works against critical thinking by casting the reader in the passive role of information consumer. As Keith Hjortshoj argues, highlighting merely \u0026quot;emphasizes the authority of the text: what its author says, believes, or knows. The practice therefore leads you toward memorization and repetition, not toward interpretation, inquiry, or criticism\u0026quot; (41). While recalling information at a later time is important, this is not the sole purpose of reading. Critical reading also involves a process of evaluating, questioning, and interpreting the text\u0026ndash;activities that highlighting severely limit.\n  Thirdly, highlighting doesn\u0026rsquo;t help you place the information into your long-term memory. Recent research suggests that taking notes by hand results in a significant boost to information retention.\n  Finally, highlighting doesn\u0026rsquo;t help you understand the structure of an argument\u0026mdash;the main goal of any critical analysis. Arguments all have a certain structure: there is a main idea supported by a series of claims, reasons, and pieces of supporting evidence. The highlighter fails to reveal this structure. Flagging key structural features of arguments (as described above in the process of annotation) will dramatically reduce the time it takes to study and will be of significant help in your writing as you make use of the texts in question.\n  Annotation strategies Since you have likely never engaged a text in such a manner, here are some strategies that you might consider as you develop a process for annotation and critical reading:\n  Use a symbol system. Develop a system of symbols to flag important aspects of a reading. Mark significant elements within the text such as the thesis, argumentative claims, and evidence. Also note when a text references other texts, authors, or events. Note places where you become confused or uncertain; later, in a second reading, you can give extra attention to these portions of the text.\n  Interrogate the text. Be ruthless. Be rigorous. Ask questions back to the author in the margins of the text. Challenge the conclusions and arguments that he or she presents by making ones of your own.\n  Summarize. Write keywords or make \u0026ldquo;microsummaries\u0026rdquo; in the margins next to each paragraph. Later, you will not have to re-read the entire document to find your place. These can be especially useful if you later use this text in your own writing.\n  Connect. Find connections between the reading and others within the course or your broader reading experience. Develop the capacity to bring other texts into dialogue with each other, imagining writing and reading as a form of social interaction.\n  "});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-2/','title':"2. Critical Notes",'content':"   Critical Reading  \u0026ldquo;We believe the best way to work on a difficult text is by rereading . . . but you can also work on the difficult text by writing, by taking possession of the work through sentences and paragraphs of your own, through summary, paraphrase, and quotation, by making another writer\u0026rsquo;s work part of your work\u0026rdquo; (12).\nBartholomae and Petrosky, \u0026ldquo;Introduction.\u0026rdquo; Ways of Reading: An Anthology for Writers\n Taking Critical Notes One objective of the annotations described in the previous chapter is to help you create a critical outline during a subsequent reading. The objective in the critical outline is to boil the entire argument down to its essence, without losing any significant detail. The name of the game here is reduction: taking something complex and unwieldy and turning it into something small and useful for study or your own writing. There is a real art to this, and you will become better and faster at this as you practice. Over time, you will train your mind to operate in such a way that you will perform these tasks almost unconsciously as you read. These critical notes will be indispensable study aids. They will also dramatically improve your writing.\nThese critical summaries are comprised of nothing more than summary, paraphrase, quotation, and your own observations and questions. Quote only the most important, memorable language. Summarize or paraphrase the rest in as objective a manner as possible. Take great care when summarizing or paraphrasing; if your work is too similar to the original text and is used later in your own writing, you may inadvertently commit plagiarism, a serious academic offense. Therefore, carefully place the writing of others into your own words and cite the text and ideas you reference in your notes.\nAs you write this critical outline you will not only try to reduce the main points of the argument, you will also ask questions and make observations of the text. You should note the argumentative points that you find yourself strongly agreeing or disagreeing with and your reasons for doing so. You might see a logical inconsistency or want the author to provide more evidence for his or her claims. You might make a note to perform some research at the library or on the Internet on an unfamiliar concept or event mentioned in the argument. Ultimately, however, you will want to determine if the argument you have read is persuasive and provide the reasons why.\nAt the end of this process, you should have a simplified\u0026mdash;but objective and accurate\u0026mdash;version of the essay that has been ruthlessly cut down to its bare essentials as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that have emerged in your process of reading. By the time you reach this stage and read over your notes, you will have taken great strides toward mastering the information or argument. Of course, if the text is difficult, you may have to repeat the process until you have a breakthrough. I cannot emphasize enough how helpful and important this process is. It will help you come to a greater understanding of the text\u0026rsquo;s claims and weaknesses while also activating your long-term memory.\nFinally, to be a successful student and scholar, you will need to preserve your notes for later use. You might use a series of organized folders on your computer or some kind of filing system in manila folders. Whatever works best for you. Retaining all of this hard work will be of great importance to you later, particularly as you engage in large research projects. As I describe in the next chapter, being a scholar\u0026mdash;or just a great student\u0026mdash;involves reusing and re-purposing prior work and information.\nSome research suggests that taking notes by hand, rather than using a computer, aids memory and improves student performance.  Critical notes strategies Developing a process for making critical notes is perhaps the most important new habit you will need to be successful in college. Here are some strategies or principles that may guide your efforts:\n  Reduce. Use summary, paraphrase, and quotation to reduce an argument to its bare bones.\n  Engage. Grapple with the ideas and arguments in the text. Ask questions and make observations. You should note the argumentative points that you find yourself strongly agreeing or disagreeing with and your reasons for doing so. You might see a logical inconsistency or want the author to provide more evidence for his or her claims. You might make a note to perform some research on an unfamiliar word, concept, or event mentioned in the argument.\n  Protect yourself. Be scrupulous when you summarize and  paraphrase source materials in your notes by ensuring that you use your own language and sentence structure. A lazy mistake at this stage may cost you dearly later if you inadvertently plagiarize material. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to meticulously cite the page numbers of all the information you include in your notes.\n  Save your work. You will need to create a system for organizing and retaining these annotations and notes for later use. You might use a series of organized folders on your computer or some kind of filing system in manila folders. Whatever works best for you.\n  "});index.add({'id':7,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-3/','title':"3. Audience",'content':"   Audience  [A] work of rhetoric is pragmatic; it comes into existence for the sake of something beyond itself; it functions ultimately to produce action or change in the world; it performs some task. In short, rhetoric is a mode of altering reality, not by the direct application of energy to objects, but by the creation of discourse which changes reality through the mediation of thought and action. The rhetor alters reality by bringing into existence a discourse of such a character that the audience, in thought and action, is so engaged that it becomes mediator of change (3-4).\n \u0026ndash; Lloyd F. Bitzer, \u0026ldquo;The Rhetorical Situation\u0026rdquo;\nConstructing the Audience Everything we write has an audience\u0026mdash;the person or people we address with our words. Even a private journal is addressed to a future version of the writer\u0026rsquo;s current self. To a large degree these audiences will determine what we say and how we say it.\nIt is easy to jump too quickly to the immediate purpose of our writing\u0026mdash;the idea we want to articulate or the viewpoint we hope to convince others to adopt. In doing so we forget that how we say something is as important as what we say, particularly when we address people who don\u0026rsquo;t share our values, culture, or life experiences. The presentation of our arguments\u0026ndash;the kinds of evidence we use to support it, the words we choose to articulate it\u0026mdash;must be tailored for our audience if we hope to be successful.\nThe nature of audiences is often elusive and complex. We may never completely understand the character and motives of our audience members; this imperfect knowledge presents a great challenge for writing arguments. Your audience members may hold views or beliefs that, while quite opaque, greatly determine receptiveness to your message. And in some cases your audience may be completely unknown to you\u0026mdash;for example, if you write for the web. Thus, imagining the audience for your message is often not an easy task; it is something that you will have to make a judgment about using whatever evidence you happen to possess at the time.\nBefore you write anything, carefully analyze those people whom you desire to persuade. To the best of your knowledge, take an inventory of what you know about the audience (or audiences) you plan to address in your writing. This analysis should give you insight into how best to present your thinking, reasoning, and evidence. You might begin such an audience analysis by asking questions such as these:\n Who is your audience or audiences? What are their values? What educational background(s) do they have? What political views do they hold? What ideas or commonalities do you share with them? What does your audience already know about the topic you plan to present? What form will your audience expect that your writing will take? (For example, if the writing occurs within a specific academic discipline, your writing will need to adopt to the preferred style for that discipline: MLA, Chicago, APA, etc.)  Questions like these can help us imagine the audience we address in our writing and gain a sense of the rhetorical situation we face. This kind of intelligence will help us make good decisions about many aspects of the writing process such as organization, diction, style, and evidence.\nPersuading the Audience While there are many types of writing, the kind you will do in college is largely concerned with argumentation and persuasion; it is a form of reasoned discourse designed to change the audience\u0026rsquo;s mind or cause them to adopt some new idea or plan of action. As you analyze your audience with these and other similar questions, imagine how these particular people will respond to the argument(s) you plan to present to them. For example:\n What sorts of constraints do you envision in getting your audience to accept your argument? If your intended audience already has known positions you oppose, how can you work carefully to convince them that their views should change? What sorts of things should you avoid presenting in your message? What common values or beliefs can be used to make your views more appealing and consistent with your audience\u0026rsquo;s outlook? How can you establish rapport with your audience, based on what you know? How can you demonstrate that you are an authority on the issue or problem at hand?  Done properly, an audience analysis will help you craft your argument more effectively, adopt a proper tone, use appropriate vocabulary, and avoid any rhetorical missteps that may alienate your readers.\nAddressing a broad audience In college your audience will most often be your professor and fellow class members. However, when you write you should learn to address a broader, general audience. This means that you will not take certain things for granted as you write and ensure that you provide good contextual information designed to help your readers gain clear understanding.\nFor example, while your professor knows the authors and readings he or she assigned in the class very well, when you reference them in your writing you should take care to introduce them, thus addressing a more expansive audience who may not be familiar with the texts or authors in question. To illustrate, consider the following two sentences:\n   1) As we talked about in class, Freire argues that banking can be undemocratic and oppressive.\nNot helpful to the audience\nThis sentence assumes that the audience knows certain things, namely Paulo Freire, his essay, and class discussions. However, writing the sentence in this way excludes everyone who is not taking part in this particular class. Imagine the confusion you would experience after reading this sentence if you had not taken part in the discussion of this piece of writing. You might wonder: What is \u0026ldquo;banking\u0026rdquo;? You mean my credit card company is oppressing me? Who is this Freire guy? Is he some authority I should trust? Where did he make this argument?\n   2) In an essay entitled \u0026ldquo;The \u0026lsquo;Banking Concept\u0026rsquo; of Education,\u0026rdquo; author and educator Paulo Freire argues that a widely practiced form of schooling that he terms \u0026ldquo;banking education\u0026rdquo; is oppressive and undemocratic.\nMuch better for the audience\nThe second sentence, however, attempts to include a much larger audience by carefully introducing important contextual information. By providing the author\u0026rsquo;s full name, his profession, the essay title, and the definition of key terms, the audience will feel that they are being addressed by your writing, rather than excluded. Further, they will gain important contextual information that is needed for understanding.\n "});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-4/','title':"4. The Joy of Reuse (Save Your Work)",'content':"   The Joy of Reuse (Save Your Work) Save all your work Most students complete their school work, turn it in to their professor, then never think of it again. These efforts then cross the event horizon into the black hole of a computer hard drive, never to emerge again. If this sounds like your standard practice, consider a change now that you\u0026rsquo;ve arrived at college. When you write something (essays, notes, reports, projects, code), or when you use something (course readings, research, data), keep a copy of it in some organized folder system so you may return to it in the future.\nTaking the time to meticulously save all this work may sound counterintuitive\u0026mdash;the class is over, right? But that essay you wrote freshman year, the notes you took on a scholarly article, the readings you dutifully annotated in your history class, may be very useful to you in some future project that you can\u0026rsquo;t anticipate now. Summarily tossing all of your work into the black hole forces you to start over again and again.\nWhile it is important to save your finished work, it is also critical that you save the research, notes, or data that contributed to that project as well. Try, as best you can, to capture all of the inputs that led to your finished work and save them in some organized way. Successful scholars and students return to prior work and research all the timereshaping, repurposing, and extending prior efforts. They understand that knowledge is cumulative: it accretes and deepens over time, often by building on what came before. This is the joy of reuse.\nStaying organized To retain your work and stay organized, you might use a simple paper system made up of manila folders. Or you might use a hierarchical folder system on your computer organized by class, project, or term. Alternatively, you might embrace a powerful bibliographic manager like Zotero. Whatever you choose, create a system for staying organized and stick with it.\nA poor file-saving strategy I assume that most students today will embrace an electronic system to manage their workflows, take notes, and compose texts. Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine two archive systems to store this typical scholarly work. Here is the first, which I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend:\n/ └── My Documents ├── Essay.docx ├── hack-dartmouth.py ├── ideas.docx ├── MyDog_Rex.jpg ├── Nosetalgia.mp3 ├── Notes2.doc ├── Notes.doc ├── Revision.docx └── syllabus.pdf      The strategy represented here breaks down very quickly for two reasons. First, after a few weeks of accumulating notes, readings, research, and other important documents, a system with no hierarchically organized folders becomes a confusing and unhelpful jumble. Secondly, the choices for naming the files actively resist discovery and recognition. What, for example, is the subject of Notes.docx? What class was it from? What lecture? What project were these notes taken for? Of the many essays you wrote last term, which one is Essay.docx? And Revision.docx is a revision of what, precisely? A year from now you won\u0026rsquo;t remember, but you may very well care at that time. Unfortunately, the folder into which you\u0026rsquo;ve dumped these files will have swelled to a debilitating size that will disrupt any attempt to make use of your hard work.\nA better file-saving strategy Instead of this haphazard and unhelpful approach, each time you place an artifact in your archive, think about your future self who will want to find something quickly, with minimal effort. An important first step in this process is to adopt some kind of logical foldering structure that quickly reduces the effort of finding a particular item. You should make considered and thoughtful decisions about your archive\u0026rsquo;s structure. Perhaps you will choose to organize your work by year, or term, or class, or project. There are pluses and minuses to any organizational schema, but changing things up later is difficult, so choose wisely.\nPerhaps the most critical step in the construction of your scholarly archive is to adopt a strict naming convention for your folders and files. Keep in mind sociologist Kieran Healy\u0026rsquo;s helpful advice that a \u0026ldquo;file or folder should always be able to tell you what it is\u0026rdquo; (7) without actually having to open it. Taking this sound advice to heart, we might revise the previous filing strategy like this:\n / └── My Documents ├── Courses │ ├── CS1-F20 │ │ └── hack-dartmouth.py │ └── Writing23-F20 │ ├── essay1-draft1-090720.docx │ ├── essay1-draft2-91520.docx │ ├── notes-Freire-110520.docx │ ├── notes-Percy-102820.docx │ ├── workshop2-draft1-101720.docx │ └── WR23-syllabus.pdf ├── Music │ └── Pusha-T-Nosetalgia.mp3 └── Photos └── 2018-MyDogRex.jpg      Your system will obviously become far more complex than the simplified example presented above. (You might, for example, want to create subfolders within a class to further organize your files). However, the key features of a good filing system are detectable here: 1) there is a logical structure to the organization, using course names and file types to determine the names of the folders and 2) the naming convention for the folders and files tell you exactly what they are without having to open them. There is no right or wrong way to make a filing system, and one size will not fit all. You will have to determine for yourself what system makes sense.\nVery large filing systems Most students would be fine if they use the simple filing system described above, where folders are determined by course or term. But if you have an expectation of a very large file system, or if you plan to share a file system with other researchers, you should consider a slightly different approach. Large collections of files are quite difficult to manage; this is especially true when additional researchers are involved with saving and editing files in the shared directory. Special care in the naming of files and folders is critical here to avoid confusion and lost data.\n While each project is different and will require its own approach, there are two best practices that should be followed in any shared research repository: 1) a plaintext README file in each project directory and 2) a shared naming convention for files and folders, described below.  Using README files for large filing systems A README file is simply a plaintext file that contains general information about a project. It functions like a roadmap that helps other researchers orient themselves to a new project and coordinate their efforts more easily. Information in a README might include some of the following:\n  A short overview of the project.\n  The names and contact information of the researchers.\n  An inventory list of all the data or documents within a directory (with a short description of what they are).\n  If the project involves software: a description of installation, dependencies, how to report bugs, licensing, etc.\n  Descriptions of file versions, if they are revised in some way.\n  If there are multiple subfolders (as in the example at right), those folder paths should be clearly indicated to show their location and contents.\n  A dated list of updates to the project as they occur.\n  Suggested naming conventions for files and subfolders.\n  Descriptions of how other interested researchers can join you and your work.\n  Descriptions of possible avenues for future work with the data or project.\n  Example README file ... /ProjectAlpha/README.md\n RESEARCH PROJECT ALPHA Include an short summary of the project here . . .\nResearchers   Jeff Goldbug: jeff.g.goldbug19@dartmouth.edu\n  Alain Frenchy: alain.frenchy@stanford.edu\n  Chloe Vinyl-Siding: chloe.vinyl-siding@gmail.com\n  Data Inventory /ProjectAlpha/Data/\n\u0026ndash; 201907-EditData.xlsx (data on edits)\n\u0026ndash; 201907-EditData.RData (R dataset file)\n\u0026ndash; 201907-GrantLetter.docx (Letter to rich foundation)\n\u0026ndash; 201907-Visualization.py (Data visualization program)\n\u0026ndash; 201910-VisualizationV01.py (Update; bugfix #14)\n\u0026ndash; 201911-VisualizationV02.py (Update; bugfix #15)\n. . .\nDocuments /ProjectAlpha/Docs/\n\u0026ndash; 201910-Bibliography.docx (Project bibliography)\n\u0026ndash; 201910-Presentation.pptx (Class presentation)\nUpdates   20191012: Updated bibliography entries\n  20191028: Update to visualization program\n  20191103: Update to visualization program\n      File-naming advice Avoid using spaces or underscores in the naming of folders, as some computer systems or programs will have difficulty with them. Instead, use CamelCase and dashes to make the folder and file names more human-readable.\nNaming top-level project folders   /ProjectAlpha Project name in CamelCase.\n  /201908-ProjectAlpha Date in YYYYMM format will help with chronological sorting in file managers.\n  /ProjectAlpha-AT Author initials may be included, if needed.\n  Naming files   FileName.docx A prototypical example.\n  FileNameV01.docx File revision/version; use two digits with leading zero for proper sorting in file managers\n  201910-FileNameDraft.docx A draft version with date\n  201911-FileNameFinal.docx A final version with date\n  201912-FileNameDraft-AT Include initials at the end of the file, if needed.\n  A very large file system example / ├── Project-Alpha │ ├── Data │ │ ├── 201907-WebScraper.py │ │ ├── 201910-DataDump01Analysis.docx │ │ ├── 201910-DataDump01.xls │ │ ├── 201910-DataDump02.xls │ │ ├── 201911-Visualization.rdata │ │ ├── 201911-VisualizationV01.rdata │ │ └── ... │ ├── Docs │ │ ├── 201908-ProceureManual.docx │ │ ├── 201911-PublicTalkPresentation.pptxt │ │ └── ... │ └── README.md └── Project-Beta      Back up all your data All of this hard work of organizing will be for nothing, however, if you don\u0026rsquo;t take pains to back up your data. Please, I beg of you, back up all your data regularly and keep a copy separate from your main working computer. There are heartbreaking stories of people losing years of work in a hard drive failure, theft, or house fire/flood. Very few people are disciplined enough to back up their work regularly on their own initiative; instead, you should embrace some kind of regular, automated system to ensure your work will survive any tragedy.\n  At some point in the future you will boot up your laptop and it will begin smoking, or be infected by ransomware, or display the BSoD.

What is Good Writing?",'content':"   What is Good Writing? Academic writing takes many forms. However, all good academic writing shares several basic characteristics:\n  Good academic writing always contains a strong thesis statement: an idea, stated as an assertion, that is the work\u0026rsquo;s central focus.\n  Good academic writing is organized: each paragraph builds upon the one before it, creating a strong sense of purpose. The paragraphs themselves are unified, generally pursuing a single idea that helps support the thesis. Each paragraph should use a strong topic sentence that clearly indicates the subject of the paragraph.\n  Good academic writing has elegant and logical transitions between paragraphs and ideas.\n  Good academic writing shows an awareness of the needs of its particular audience by contextualizing the ideas, texts, authors, debates, theories, or histories that are discussed within it.\n  Good academic writing is relevant, useful, and interesting to its intended audience.\n  Good academic writing skillfully uses appropriate evidence to support claims and it properly credits outside sources with citations.\n  Good academic writing is precise, clear, and concise.\n  "});index.add({'id':10,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-6/','title':"6. Types of College Writing",'content':"   Types of College Writing Most students are trained in high school to write what is known as a five-paragraph essay\u0026mdash;a form of writing containing an introduction, three paragraphs of support, and a summary conclusion. In that it encourages students to think about introductions, structure, organization, paragraphing, evidence, and reasoning, the five-paragraph essay is good training for novice writers. However, this particular rhetorical form is extremely limiting: only certain, rather paltry, thoughts and ideas may be placed within a five paragraph structure.\nYour college coursework will require that you reach for rhetorical forms of an entirely different nature. Little of the thinking you will be challenged to do in college will fit within the constraints of the five-paragraph essay. Big ideas, complex reasoning, and deep inquiry will require more sophisticated structures. Rather than force all of your reasoning and inquiry into a preformulated and supposedly universal structure, you will be asked to embrace the idea that the formal properties of a piece of writing are determined by the particular needs of the argument. Thus, the shape of your reasoning will determine the essay\u0026rsquo;s form. Furthermore, every discipline has its own particular way(s) of writing; as you progress through your coursework you will become more familiar with how your chosen field of study presents its own kind of academic discourse.\nWhile academic writing takes on many forms, the following are the most common modes of writing you will encounter. However, it is perhaps misleading to present these various modes of academic writing as discrete things. Please understand that there are no definite lines between these various kinds of academic writing, and it is uncommon to write in one mode exclusively. The rhetorical tasks you face in college will often require you to combine these modes in various ways within a single piece of writing. For example, an argument paper will often involve synthesis and analysis, a research essay may use one or more theories, and a theory paper might use close reading and analysis.\nArgument An argument paper requires you to make a claim about a debatable issue and then defend that claim using evidence and reasoning. Virtually all academic writing is argumentative in nature. Argumentative essays generally begin with an introduction that explains the context for the argument and the specific issue, problem, or question that the paper will address. Typically, the author of an argument will use the end of the introduction to present a thesis\u0026mdash;the main idea or claim of the essay. However, this is not always the case. For example, one argumentative form known as the exploratory essay replaces the thesis with a question that is used to initiate an inquiry into an issue or problem. Typically, the thesis appears near the end of this kind of essay, as the culmination of a process of reasoning and inquiry.\nResponse A response paper gives you free license to respond to a text without guidance. Rather than a prompt or prescribed approach given to you by a professor, a response paper allows you to engage a text on your own terms and write from your own perspective.\nWhile a response paper allows you to write about something you choose, your effort should not be an impressionistic one where you only talk about your personal feelings\u0026mdash;what you like or dislike about the text. Rather, you should seek to evaluate and engage the claims and ideas you find in the text. Thus, a response is always argumentative in nature in that you will make claims and use reasoning and evidence as support.\nYour response may seek to take issue with some of the thinking or reasoning put forth in the reading. However, a good response doesn\u0026rsquo;t just say \u0026ldquo;I agree with X\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I disagree with Y.\u0026rdquo; Instead, explicit reasons are stated and explanations are made that challenge or support the writer\u0026rsquo;s ideas. A good response essay might alternatively attempt to forge a connection between two or more texts by demonstrating a relationship between the ideas or arguments involved\u0026mdash;contrasting, comparing, and evaluating the claims or ideas in the texts. For example, how might Author A respond to Author B? How do their views compare? Can their views be reconciled? Is one view superior?\nExposition An expository essay is one in which you report on, define, summarize, clarify and/or explain a concept, process, idea, or text. Expository essays involve several key patterns such as compare and contrast, cause and effect, problem and solution, or definition. The purpose of this kind of writing is to provide information to an audience unfamiliar with the subject or to demonstrate for a professor that you have understood course material.\nSynthesis As the name suggests, synthesis essays emphasize combining and connecting. Your focus in a synthesis essay is to explain to your audience the ways in which two or more arguments or ideas relate to one another.\nRather than try to summarize the essays separately, a synthesis will attempt to discover the various things that the authors discuss\u0026mdash;the questions, ideas, and arguments they have in common\u0026mdash;then present those things in an organized and meaningful way. Thus, your objective in a synthesis is to bring two or more distinct sources into a relationship by explaining to your reader the various ways in which the sources are in dialogue.\nStudents attempting synthesis for the first time often make the mistake of organizing their essays by source. For example, this student might introduce two authors in her introduction, summarize Author A, summarize Author B, then conclude by noting the broad similarities and differences in the two authors\u0026rsquo; thinking. This is not synthesis. In a synthesis essay it is generally best to organize your essay by topic or questions at issue rather than by sources.\nTo begin a synthesis, ask yourself the following questions about the readings you plan to synthesize:\n What are the positions, arguments, and ideas that the source materials have in common? Are the authors all concerned about the same problem(s)? Are their arguments similar or do they differ in some respects? What reasoning supports their arguments? Do they offer similar conclusions or are there differences?  Answering these questions exhaustively will help you write an essay that examines the relationship(s) between the various authors\u0026rsquo; arguments, comparing and contrasting their views.\nSynthesis is very textual in nature: you must show explicit textual evidence for each of the claims you attribute to the authors. Using summary, paraphrase, and quotation, compare and contrast the authors\u0026rsquo; positions. Make sure to cite each of these appropriately. Use clear signal phrases to transition between your presentations of the various author\u0026rsquo;s ideas or works.\nAnalysis/Close Reading Analytical writing involves paying close attention to particular elements of a thing and how those discrete elements work together to produce a whole. While analysis always involves breaking things down and meticulously examining the particulars, the ultimate goal of any analysis is to explain what something means or how it works. In the case of literary criticism, for example, you might perform an analysis of a poem and then attempt to explain its meaning to your audience. Rather than quote an outside authority, you will instead provide your interpretation of the text using only the words of the poem itself as evidence. This process is often referred to as \u0026ldquo;close reading.\u0026rdquo; While this process may be performed on a poem or a scene in a novel, a close reading may also be made of a film sequence, a piece of artwork, a photograph, a built structure, a tribal practice, or even a music video or new fashion trend.\nIn more scientific disciplines you might examine a collection of data, then describe in detail how this information leads to a broader explanation, theory, or conclusion. In all cases, the analysis you perform should be used to support a strong thesis\u0026mdash;an idea or that you want your audience to accept as true.\nTheoretical Writing The theoretical essay is one of the most common forms of academic writing. Using a theory is like using a tool: you take it with you to your job of reading and interpreting a text and use it to uncover ideas and shape thoughts. Sometimes people refer to theoretical arguments as \u0026ldquo;lens\u0026rdquo; essays since you view the text(s) you are analyzing through the theory you have chosen. Like a lens, the theory will color the text, bring certain things into focus, and make others fade out of view.\nWe might, for example, use a feminist theory to examine a novel. In this case, the theory would sensitize us to certain aspects of the text such as the power relationships between the female and male characters or how social authorities or institutions treat men and women differently. Alternatively, we might perform a Marxist analysis which would cause us to study how social class and disparities in wealth shape the narrative and the various characters\u0026rsquo; outcomes in the fictional world they inhabit. But theory is not just for the analysis of fiction. We might, for example, appropriate some economic, sociological, or anthropological theory to analyze how people behave at the mall or use some psychological model to explain the decision to join a fraternity.\nThere is an extraordinary variety of extant theoretical models that may be used for the interpretation of texts, cultural forms, and various kinds of data. In fact, every field of study uses theory in some way\u0026mdash;from literary criticism to the hard sciences. As you begin to specialize within a chosen discipline of study, you will encounter the theoretical models that are important for that discipline.\nResearch A research paper requires you to draw on outside sources in addition to your own thinking. Research writing often includes many of the kinds of writing described above. Indeed, research writing involves a coordination of all of the previously mentioned skills and rhetorical modes. For example, your research paper may involve one or more theories, perform various kinds of analysis, synthesize the thinking of many other writers or thinkers, and make one or more arguments.\nWhen you make an academic argument, you are often entering a conversation that existed long before you appeared. When you write, you must remain mindful of the conversations that came before and nestle your views within those that already exist. In short, you must demonstrate that your ideas have a context. This is where research comes into play. Before you can responsibly offer your views, you must know what the critical conversation is, what arguments are being made, and what questions are important (or irrelevant) to the debate.\nProperly done, research ensures that what you write is a true contribution to the ongoing discussion, and not a pointless exercise in repetition. The whole point, after all, is to move the scholarly conversation further down the road, not endlessly spin our wheels.\n"});index.add({'id':11,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-7/','title':"7. Paragraphs and Topic Sentences",'content':"   Paragraphs \u0026amp; Topic Sentences  I can remember picking up my father\u0026rsquo;s books before I could read. The words themselves were mostly foreign, but I still remember the exact moment when I first understood, with a sudden clarity, the purpose of a paragraph. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the vocabulary to say \u0026quot;paragraph,\u0026quot; but I realized that a paragraph was a fence that held words. The words inside a paragraph worked together for a common purpose. They had some specific reason for being inside the same fence.\nSherman Alexie, \u0026ldquo;Superman and Me\u0026quot;.\n A paragraph is a unit of text devoted to developing an idea. The idea is usually stated in a topic sentence. The topic sentence most commonly appears as the paragraph\u0026rsquo;s first sentence; however, in what is known as a periodic paragraph, the topic sentence will appear at the end.\nParagraphs should be unified. Every sentence in the paragraph should focus in some way on the main idea expressed in the topic sentence. Further, the paragraph\u0026rsquo;s individual sentences should be presented in a logical order and flow naturally from one to the other. While this is not a strict rule, it may be helpful to think of paragraphs as miniature essays, each with their own thesis, development, and proof.\nHow can I make my paragraphs unified?   Identify the main idea of the paragraph then remove or revise any sentence that does not develop that main idea or repeats ideas offered in another sentence.\n  Consider the order of your sentences. Is there a reason why they are in the order they are, or do they need to be rearranged to make sense to a reader?\n  Think about employing some transitions at the beginning of some of the sentences. These will help you pinpoint the relationships between your ideas/sentences and thus clarify these relationships for your reader. To help guide your readers in understanding the relationships between the sentences of your paragraphs, you might use words like For example, However, Additionally, Specifically, On the other hand, Obviously, As a result, In distinction to, In other words, Significantly, etc.\n  Repeat key words to remind your audience of the paragraph\u0026rsquo;s focus.\n  Strong topic sentences Topic sentences function like a miniature thesis that communicates the purpose or main idea of a paragraph. It is important that your topic sentences are clear and accurately reflect the nature of the paragraph it initiates.\nMost commonly, topic sentences are strong, declarative statements that make a claim. The sentences that follow the topic sentence in the paragraph are used to support that claim. However, a topic sentence may also be a question. In this case, the sentences that follow the topic sentence are used to move toward a conclusion or further development or deepening of the question.\nExample paragraphs This paragraph is part of a larger student essay performing a theoretical analysis of Wes Anderson\u0026rsquo;s 1998 film Rushmore. The essay uses theoretical ideas borrowed from Brazilian educational theorist Paulo Freire. According the the author, the film\u0026rsquo;s central character, Max Fischer, fails to live up to the standards for education that Freire articulates.\nAn incoherent paragraph: Liberation education culminates in an effort to change the world. However, according to Freire, this change must embrace a communitarian philosophy. This is what Max Fischer fails to understand. Max is keen to change the world, shaping it to his needs and wants, but he fails to understand Freire\u0026rsquo;s imperatives on community, dialogue and consensus. The views, ideas, and values held by a community are used to change the world, not one individual\u0026rsquo;s desire. Rather than shape the world with others, Max insists on altering the world for himself alone. This site is under construction and is not ready for use. Mistakes, broken links, and the like should be expected.  The topic sentence of the paragraph does not represent the true nature of the paragraph. The paragraph is about Max\u0026rsquo;s failure to embrace a core idea expressed by Freire; however, the topic sentence suggests the paragraph will only discuss something called \u0026ldquo;liberation education.\u0026rdquo; Further, the paragraph\u0026rsquo;s sentences are not presented in a helpful or logical order.\nRevised paragraph: Although Freire argues that liberation education culminates in an effort to change the world, Max Fischer\u0026rsquo;s efforts in this regard fail to embrace the philosophy of community that Freire demands. While Freire beckons us to become \u0026ldquo;transformers of the world\u0026rdquo; (73), he insists that it must only happen after a process of \u0026ldquo;dialogue\u0026rdquo;: an open exchange of ideas between equal partners (78-9). For Freire, these moments of co-inquiry are used to transform the world into a more democratic and free society (86). While Max is keen to change the world, he selfishly shapes it to his own needs and wants, failing to understand Freire\u0026rsquo;s insistence on community, dialogue, and consensus. Rather than shape the world with others, as Freire recommends, Max insists on altering the world for himself alone.  This revised paragraph uses the topic sentence to announce that the passage will focus on how Max Fischer fails to live up to a standard expressed by Freire. This new topic sentence reflects the nature of the paragraph much more faithfully. Furthermore, the author arranges the sentences so as to educate the audience about the Freire\u0026rsquo;s theory before using it to criticize the actions of the film\u0026rsquo;s main character, Max Fischer. The result is a more logical and intelligible paragraph.\n"});index.add({'id':12,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/','title':"8. Working with Sources",'content':"   Working with Sources  The ugly fact is books are made out of books.\n\u0026ndash;Cormac McCarthy\n Academic writing always involves integrating the thinking of others into your own writing. There are only three ways that the words and ideas of others may appear in your writing: summary, paraphrase, and quotation. Writing an academic paper requires a mastery of all three skills. It is critical to always give credit to the other authors whose ideas or words you borrow. Failing to do so may result in the accusation of plagiarism. The way scholars avoid plagiarism is by using signal phrases and citations.\nUsing signal phrases What are they? Signal phrases are words that tell your readers that you are borrowing text or ideas from a source. The borrowed material could be quoted, summarized, or paraphrased. The signal phrase, as the name suggests, tells your reader that you are about to begin borrowing; after you have presented the borrowed material, conclude with a citation to tell your reader that the borrowing has concluded. Using signal phrases and citations to bookend your borrowings from other texts helps you avoid plagiarism, organize your writing, and help your readers understand how your views relate to the views of the other writers you present.\nWhy use them?   They make it clear when you are transitioning from your own ideas and writing to the ideas and writing of others and back again.\n  They make it clear when you have begun to paraphrase or summarize. Unlike quotations, paraphrases and summaries are not formatted with quotation marks; therefore, it is difficult for readers to know when or where you have begun to paraphrase or summarize unless you include signal phrases and citations.\n  They make the tone of your paper more academic and authoritative.\n  They compel you to articulate how your ideas relate to those you have borrowed from others. This will direct your attention to the precise ways in which authors agree or disagree with you or each other, and allow you to make these intersections clear to your reader.\n  Using these signal phrases will help you to avoid plagiarism.\n  How do you construct a signal phrase?   Use the author's name. The first time you mention an author, include the author\u0026rsquo;s full name, the title of his or her work, and perhaps a brief statement indicating the author\u0026rsquo;s credentials. Once you have introduced an author in your paper, only use his or her last name if you mention him or her again.\n  Use a strong verb to characterize what the author has done. The list below has possible selections. Be sure to pick a verb that most precisely describes the author\u0026rsquo;s intent or action. For example:\n  asserts, argues, believes, claims, emphasizes, insists, observes, reports, suggests, acknowledges, admires, agrees, corroborates, endorses, extols, praises, verifies, illustrates, expands on, rejects, complicates, contends, contradicts, denies, disagrees, refutes, questions, warns, proposes, implores, exhorts, demands, calls for, recommends, urges, advocates, wonders, asks, rejects, encourages.  Example of a signal phrase use Here is an example of a student properly using signal phrases and citations to indicate borrowings from other sources:\n[Student Essay]\n A number of scholarly views exist that attempt to explain the nature and origins of Taoist religious practices. In his book The Tao Practice, scholar Rico Burgerton argues that \u0026ldquo;Taoism emerged during a period of unprecedented struggle, deprivation, and suffering in the fourth century BCE\u0026rdquo; (89). This historical condition, he explains, resulted in religious and cultural practices and beliefs that valued asceticism and practiced detachment from desire (12). However, other historians disagree. In his \u0026ldquo;Up and Down of the Tao,\u0026rdquo; Li Chang argues that Taoism as we know it was largely a creation of the 17th-century, a time of relative prosperity, radical socio-political change, and modernization in China (5). Taoist asceticism was actually a rejection of this tumultuous cultural transformationan expression of nostalgia for a simpler time in the ancient Chinese past (22). But which is the correct answer? Did Taoism emerge in a time of poverty or a time of plenty? In my view, both views are problematic . . .   \n Notice here how the author of this paragraph uses signal phrases and citations to distinguish his voice from the two source texts he is using. The student announces that he is borrowing words or ideas (in the form of quotations, summary, or paraphrase) with a signal phrase and the author\u0026rsquo;s name, then bookends the borrowing with a citation. The paragraph concludes with the student transitioning from the source texts to his own thoughts, posing a series of questions that he will try to answer in the reminder of the paper. This move is a foundational building block of all academic writing. This is one of the more important skills to master for success in academic writing contexts.\nWe can represent this important tactic with the following formula:\n signal phrase + borrowed text/idea + citation.  Memorize this. Burn it into your memory. Practice it.\nQuotation When should I quote something? Quotation is the inclusion of another author\u0026rsquo;s exact wording in your own writing. While quotation is a critical element of all academic writing, you must be judicious in its use. Only quote when the rhetorical situation requires it. The overuse of quotation can make you appear lazy or lacking in confidence. That said, there are moments when quotations are entirely justified. For example:\n  When you are interpreting literature such as a poem or novel, the specific language used in the text is the subject of your essay. That is to say, your argument is about the meaning of the exact words chosen by the author for his or her literary work. It is critical in these instances to use quotations from the literary text and then explain what those words mean to your audience\u0026mdash;a process known as \u0026ldquo;close reading\u0026rdquo; in literary studies.\n  When you are making an argument it is often helpful to use the words of known authorities to help make your case. While you may not be a doctor, a physicist, or professional journalist, you may use their words and arguments to help give credibility to your ideas. While using the exact words of these important authorities can be rhetorically effective, make sure to use them prudently. If your essay becomes a mere tissue of quotation, your authority as an author is undermined. The strongest voice in your essay should be your own. Allow these other voices to be briefly heard; don\u0026rsquo;t allow them to drown out your own voice.\n  When the source text contains language that is memorable, beautiful, or particularly apt, quotation is justified. If you feel that summarizing or paraphrasing would do violence to the original language, using a quotation is often the best choice.\n  A quotation is often necessary when you describe legal discourse (such as a law or court ruling) where words cannot be paraphrased or summarized without altering the meaning and effect of the legal language.\n  For most other circumstances, summary or paraphrase of the original language is best.\nHow do I integrate quoted material?   Use a signal phrase to introduce the quoted passage.\n  Use quotation marks.\n  Provide a citation in your chosen format, such as MLA or Chicago.\n  If necessary, use ellipsis or brackets to alter the source, satisfy grammar, or provide clarifying information.\n  What should I avoid?   Avoid excessive use of quotation. If you quote too often it can make it appear that you have not fully read or understood the source material. It may also make your writing appear lazy and thoughtless.\n  Avoid excessive use of block quotation. Block quotations should be rare; reserve them for special language that you believe cannot be summarized or paraphrased. Try instead to use a mixture of quotation, paraphrase, and selective quotation to integrate the source material into your writing.\n  Avoid inserting a quote within your writing without providing your commentary or explanation. Explain to your audience what your quotes mean and connect them to your broader argument so that the reader will understand how to interpret them.\n  Avoid inserting quotations without signal phrases. Quotations should be introduced and woven into your own writing. They should rarely stand alone.\n  What if the original quotation has an error? Occasionally you will want to quote a text that contains an error of some sort. Perhaps the author used the wrong word or there is a misspelling or grammatical error. In these cases, you may want to indicate to your readers that the error exists in the original text and is not a sloppy accident of your own making. To communicate this to your readers, use the Latin term sic, or \u0026ldquo;thus,\u0026rdquo; next to the offending word or error. For example:\n According to the report, \u0026ldquo;The children were told to make there [sic] beds\u0026rdquo; (98).  Example of a quotation Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine that the following is the source text that you would like to quote in your own writing:\n[Source Text]\n At the heart of the environmentalist worldview is the conviction that human physical and spiritual health depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state. Earth is our home in the full, genetic sense, where humanity and its ancestors existed for all the millions of years of their evolution. Natural ecosystems\u0026mdash;forests, coral reefs, marine blue waters\u0026mdash;maintain the world exactly as we would wish it to be maintained. Our body and our mind evolved precisely to live in this particular planetary environment and no other. When we debase the global environment and extinguish the variety of life, we are dismantling a support system that is too complex to understand, let alone replace, in the foreseeable future (238).\n\u0026ndash; E.O. Wilson, \u0026ldquo;Is Humanity Suicidal?\u0026rdquo;   \nSample quotations from the source text:   In a recent essay, scientist E.O. Wilson considers a dark truth about humanity: \u0026ldquo;we are dismantling a support system that is too complex to understand, let alone replace, in the foreseeable future\u0026rdquo; (238).\n  \u0026ldquo;At the heart of the environmentalist worldview,\u0026rdquo; claims scientist E.O. Wilson, \u0026ldquo;is the conviction that human physical and spiritual health depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state\u0026rdquo; (238).\n  One important biologist insists that if we \u0026ldquo;debase\u0026rdquo; the planet we risk \u0026ldquo;dismantling a support system\u0026rdquo; that is too complicated to understand or replace (Wilson 238).\n  Summary In a summary you present the ideas of another writer in a condensed form. The length of a summary is dictated by your rhetorical needs, but they are always shorter than the original text. For example, the summary of a large book could be 20 pages, one paragraph, or one sentence. Although a summary sacrifices specificity and detail in the interest of brevity, it must always remain a faithful representation of the original text.\nWhy are summaries important? Summary is one of the central skills needed for academic writing. Summary often appears in an academic essay\u0026rsquo;s introductory section(s) to provide readers with background information or historical context. It is also used to explain complex scholarly conversations that the writer plans to engage with his or her essay. An excellent summary of this broader scholarly conversation goes far to establish you as a knowledgeable authority with your readerssomeone whose views should be trusted and considered. Summary is particularly useful when we make use of secondary sources in our writing. If we want to use or introduce another source in our own writing, we use summary to inform our audience about the arguments and ideas contained within it in an abbreviated form. We also make significant use of summary in the complex work of , where we explain how two or more texts relate to one another.\nHow do I incorporate summaries?  Since summaries do not use quotation marks, you must take care to indicate to your readers that you are borrowing from the work of others. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a  and a citation. Think of the signal phrase and the citation as a way to bookend a borrowing from a source. The signal phrase alerts readers that you are about to borrow from another text; the  is used to show that the borrowing has concluded. An appropriate  always notes the page(s) summarized.  What should I avoid?  Avoid plagiarizing. Remember, summarized material is still borrowed material, even though you have greatly condensed it and put it entirely in your own words. Make sure that any summarized material is introduced with a  and concluded with a .  Example of a summary Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine that the following is the source text that you would like to summarize in your own writing:\n[Source Text]\n When academic territories were parceled out in the early twentieth century, anthropology got the tellers of tales and history got the keepers of written records. As anthropology and history diverged, human differences that hinged on literacy assumed an undeserved significance. Working with oral, preindustrial, prestate societies, anthropologists acknowledged the power of culture and of a received worldview; they knew that the folk conception of the world was not narrowly tied to proof and evidence. But with the disciplinary boundary overdrawn, it was easy for historians to assume that literacy, the modern state, and the commercial world had produced a different sort of creature entirely\u0026mdash;humans less inclined to put myth over reality, more inclined to measure their beliefs by the standard of accuracy and practicality. (35)\nPatricia Nelson Limerick, The Legacy of Conquest.\n   Sample summary from the source text:  As Patricia Nelson Limerick argues in The Legacy of Conquest, historians have falsely assumed that literate societies with vibrant economies and systems of governance were never beholden to myth or superstition (35).  Paraphrasing Think of paraphrase as a translation from English into English. It involves taking language from a source, putting it into your own words, and arranging it within your own original sentence structure(s). Unlike summary, which aims to reduce or distill an idea, a paraphrase should be similar in length to the original passage.\nWhy are paraphrases important? Accurate paraphrase demonstrates mastery of your source materials and indicates an author who is in control of his or her own writing and thinking. Whereas excessive quotation may reveal an uncertain or tentative author, paraphrase demonstrates control and confidence. However, ensure that your paraphrases do justice to the original, or risk compromising your authority with your readers.\nHow do I incorporate paraphrases?   Like summaries, paraphrases do not use quotation marks. As a result, you must take care to indicate to your readers that you are borrowing from the work of others with a signal phrase and citation. As you move from your own writing to the paraphrase of others, use a signal phrase to indicate this transition.\n  End the paraphrase with an appropriate citation.\n  What should I avoid?   Avoid plagiarizing. Remember, paraphrased material is still borrowed material, even though you have put it in your own words. Make sure that any paraphrased material is introduced with a signal phrase and concluded with a citation.\n  Avoid patchwriting. patchwriting is a process of merely changing a word or a phrase here or there from the original text and presenting the result as your own writing. Instead, ensure that you use your own words and sentence structure in your paraphrase.\n  Example of a paraphrase Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine that the following is the source text that you would like to paraphrase in your own writing:\n[Source Text]\n When academic territories were parceled out in the early twentieth century, anthropology got the tellers of tales and history got the keepers of written records.

(35)\nPatricia Nelson Limerick, The Legacy of Conquest.\n    Sample paraphrase from the source text:  In The Legacy of Conquest, Patricia Nelson Limerick argues that during the early part of the last century the disciplines of anthropology and history went their separate ways. While anthropology focused on unlettered and illiterate communities, history became the study of societies who produced texts and records. Within the field of anthropology, a firm belief developed that oral cultures were characterized by mythological worldviews and superstitious beliefs; on the other hand, historians improperly assumed that literate cultures were filled with individuals who only used reason and evidence to guide their thinking (35).

Plagiarism",'content':"   Plagiarism  Perish those who said our good things before we did.\n\u0026ndash;Aelius Donatus\n Definition of plagiarism In the Academic Honor Principle, Dartmouth College defines plagiarism as\n the submission or presentation of work, in any form, that is not a student\u0026rsquo;s own, without acknowledgment of the source. With specific regard to papers, a simple rule dictates when it is necessary to acknowledge sources. If a student obtains information or ideas from an outside source, that source must be acknowledged. Another rule to follow is that any direct quotation must be placed in quotation marks, and the source immediately cited. Students are responsible for the information concerning plagiarism found in Sources and Citations at Dartmouth College.\n Consult the Academic Honor Principle for more information on academic dishonesty and a description of its severe consequences.\nExamples of plagiarism While plagiarism appears in many forms and degrees, we may broadly classify them in three categories:\n  the wholesale copying of another\u0026rsquo;s essay or project\n  the adoption of certain phrases or words from another text without proper attribution (also known as \u0026ldquo;patchwriting\u0026rdquo;)\n  the paraphrase of another\u0026rsquo;s writing without proper attribution or citation.\n  Below you will find examples of these three categories of plagiarism, each one plagiarizing a passage taken from Patricia Nelson Limerick\u0026rsquo;s 1987 book, The Legacy of Conquest:\n[Source Text]\n When academic territories were parceled out in the early twentieth century, anthropology got the tellers of tales and history got the keepers of written records. As anthropology and history diverged, human differences that hinged on literacy assumed an undeserved significance.

(35)\nPatricia Nelson Limerick, The Legacy of Conquest.\n    Word-for-word copying Word-for-word copying, such as the following example, is completely unacceptable whether it occurs by mistake or design. Care must be taken when taking notes and typing quotations to avoid representing the words of other authors as your own:\n As we all know, when academic territories were parceled out in the early twentieth century, anthropology got the tellers of tales and history got the keepers of written records. This made historians assume that literacy, the modern state, and the commercial world had produced a different sort of creature entirely\u0026mdash;humans less inclined to put myth over reality, more inclined to measure their beliefs by the standard of accuracy and practicality.\n  This passage fails to use quotation marks to indicate borrowed language. It additionally fails to cite the source of the borrowed language.  Patchwriting This form of plagiarism is often the result of sloppiness in the note-taking or drafting process. Using patches of a source text is perfectly reasonable; however, make sure that quotation marks are used and citations are given:\n When the academic territories were parceled out in the early 1900s, the disciplines diverged. This made the differences that human beings had with regard to literacy assume an undeserved significance. By overdrawing this disciplinary boundary, historians began to believe that the subjects they studied were less inclined to put myth over reality and more likely to measure their beliefs through the excellent standards of accuracy and practicality (Limerick 35).\n  While this student does acknowledge the source she is borrowing from, she fails to enclose words and phrases that come directly from the text.  Paraphrase without attribution The following paraphrase would be perfectly acceptable were it to have a signal phrase and a citation indicating that the ideas were taken from another author\u0026rsquo;s work. Even though no language was taken directly from the source text, the ideas must be attributed to the author from whom they were borrowed. As it stands now, the author is declaring that he came up with these ideas and arguments himself:\n During the early part of the last century the disciplines of anthropology and history separated. While anthropology focused on unlettered and illiterate communities, history became the study of societies who produced texts and records. Within the field of anthropology, a firm belief developed that oral cultures were characterized by mythological worldviews and superstitious beliefs; on the other hand, historians assumed that literate cultures were filled with individuals who only used reason and evidence to guide their thinking.\n  This is an excellent paraphrase of the text. But it is still plagiarism unless you cite it appropriately.  "});index.add({'id':14,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-9/','title':"9. Altering Sources",'content':"   Altering Sources In your life as a writer you will frequently encounter situations where you must alter a source in some way. Generally, these alterations are used to satisfy grammar and/or make your writing easier to follow by removing or adding words or phrases.\nTo alter or add words to a source\n To indicate that we have altered or added words to a source text in our own writing we use square brackets: [ ].   To remove words from a source\n To indicate that we have removed words from a source text we use ellipses\u0026mdash;a series of periods to mark where something has been removed from the source.   These alterations should be used sparingly. In fact, you should only alter a source if there is no other practical way to include the material in a quotation. Overuse of brackets or ellipsis will make your writing appear artless and lazy. However, when altering a source proves an indispensable path to crafting readable prose, brackets and ellipsis are helpful tools.\nBe careful that the quote you present to the reader is an accurate reflection of the original text; it is improper to alter a text so that it says something the author did not really intend.\nEllipsis . . . We use ellipses to show when we have altered a source text by omitting words, sentences, or paragraphs. However, be careful that the quote you present to the reader is an accurate reflection of the original text.\nHow do I use ellipsis? [Source Text]\n At the heart of the environmentalist worldview is the conviction that human physical and spiritual health depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state. Earth is our home in the full, genetic sense, where humanity and its ancestors existed for all the millions of years of their evolution. Natural ecosystems\u0026mdash;forests, coral reefs, marine blue waters\u0026mdash;maintain the world exactly as we would wish it to be maintained. Our body and our mind evolved precisely to live in this particular planetary environment and no other. When we debase the global environment and extinguish the variety of life, we are dismantling a support system that is too complex to understand, let alone replace, in the foreseeable future (238).\n\u0026ndash; E.O. Wilson, \u0026ldquo;Is Humanity Suicidal?\u0026rdquo;   \n   Omission in the middle of a sentence:\n Wilson argues that \u0026ldquo;Natural ecosystems . . . maintain the world exactly as we would wish it to be maintained\u0026rdquo; (50).\n   Omission of the ending of one sentence and the beginning of another:\n As Wilson states, \u0026ldquo;At the heart of the environmentalist worldview is the conviction that human physical and spiritual health depends on sustaining the planet . . . . where humanity and its ancestors existed for all the millions of years of their evolution\u0026rdquo; (50).\n   Omission of one or more sentences:\n Wilson says that \u0026ldquo;At the heart of the environmentalist worldview is the conviction that human physical and spiritual health depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state. . . . When we debase the global environment and extinguish the variety of life, we are dismantling a support system that is too complex to understand, let alone replace, in the foreseeable future\u0026rdquo; (50).\n   Special considerations with ellipsis   Omission at the beginning of a sentence:\nIt is often unnecessary to use ellipsis when you have omitted the beginning of a sentence. Since the portion of the quote you present will begin with a lower case letter, it will be obvious to the reader that it does not begin the sentence in the original text. Thus, for the most part, ellipsis will only occur in the middle or the end of a sentence. Consider the following examples; only example c requires the use of ellipsis to begin a quote:\na) With bracket:\n \u0026ldquo;[H]uman physical and spiritual health,\u0026rdquo; Wilson writes, \u0026ldquo;depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state\u0026rdquo; (50).\n b) Lowercase letter:\n According to Wilson, \u0026ldquo;human physical and spiritual health depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state\u0026rdquo; (50).\n c) Proper noun in the original:\n As Terrance Smith relates, \u0026ldquo;. . . Wilson argues that we must protect the planet if we want to protect ourselves\u0026rdquo; (99).\n Since \u0026ldquo;Wilson\u0026rdquo; is a proper noun, it is capitalized. This may lead the reader to falsely assume that it is the beginning of a sentence in the original text. Therefore, ellipsis is used to clarify that the original sentence begins earlier.\n  Using a short phrase or word:\nWhen quoting a short phrase or single word there is no need to use ellipsis since it will be clear to your readers that this has been taken from a longer sentence:\n Wilson describes Earth as \u0026ldquo;our home\u0026rdquo; (50).\n   [Brackets]  How do I use brackets? Square brackets are used to indicate an alteration or addition to a source text. Generally, you will use brackets in three circumstances: 1) to add clarifying information, 2) to alter a word in the interest of grammar, or 3) to alter capitalization. A few examples:\n  James McMinnis maintains that \u0026ldquo;the city [Los Angeles] is one of the most horrific places on the face of the earth\u0026rdquo; (88).\n  Dillard concludes her essay by saying that she \u0026ldquo;think[s] it would be well, and proper, and obedient, and pure, to grasp your one necessity and not let it go\u0026rdquo; (34).\n  \u0026ldquo;[H]uman physical and spiritual health,\u0026rdquo; Wilson writes, \u0026ldquo;depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state\u0026rdquo; (50).\n  "});index.add({'id':15,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-14/','title':"14.

Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record.

And I use sentences of medium length.

Documentation of Sources",'content':"   Documentation of Sources Accurately documenting sources is a vital aspect of any process of inquiry. If you fail to properly document your sources, your readers will be unable to follow your research, validate your claims, or judge the quality of your argument. Furthermore, failing to properly cite a source (whether summarized, paraphrased, or quoted) opens you to the charge of plagiarism, a serious academic offense.\nScholars avoid plagiarism and give credit to the thinking and writing of others using a variety of citation formats, or \u0026ldquo;styles.\u0026rdquo; As you work to complete your degree in college you will encounter a number of these citation formats. In fact, each discipline has a preferred style. The humanities use MLA, psychology uses APA, history and other social sciences use Chicago. There are many others. As you begin to specialize in a particular field of study, you will be required to master the citation style used by your discipline. This brief handbook, however, will only introduce you to two of the most common styles: MLA and Chicago.\nAlthough citation formats differ significantly, they all have two primary components: in-text citations and a bibliography. As the name suggests, in-text citations are used to reference the work of others within the text itself; the bibliography contains an ordered list of all the in-text citations contained within a piece of writing.\n"});index.add({'id':17,'href':'/Assignments/','title':"Assignments",'content':""});index.add({'id':18,'href':'/Assignments/essays/','title':"Essays",'content':""});index.add({'id':19,'href':'/Assignments/workshops/','title':"Workshops",'content':""});index.add({'id':20,'href':'/courses/writing-3/syllabus/','title':"Syllabus",'content':"Introduction Here is some shit about me and the class and the fucking pandemic shit we are facing.

Here are a few marginally helpful things that may help you keep a good relationship with your teachers.\nTactical Errors Timing is everything  Asking your professor to meet and discuss your idea(s) for a project shortly before it is due reveals that you haven\u0026rsquo;t started yet. There is a certain cutoff point after which you should not reveal such things to the person who will grade your work. While it is quite possible for a good student to write something amazing overnight, revealing this to your professor may not be to your advantage.   Did I miss anything important?   Did I miss anything?\nThis is one of the most annoying questions professors hear. Never ask your professor if you \u0026ldquo;missed anything important\u0026rdquo; on a day you were absent. Yes, yes you did. It is all important. (And even if it\u0026rsquo;s not, pretend that it is).\n  The Course Sequence Writing 2-3 is an introduction to academic writing and research. The overarching objective of this course is to prepare you for the rigors of the academic life. To succeed in a scholarly environment we must develop good habits of inquiry, analysis, and communication. We will cultivate these critical practices through rigorous group inquiry—by reading and analyzing a series of demanding texts and articulating responses to them in the form of essays. Shorter writing assignments will focus on a number of skills that are important for taking part in academic conversations. Among these are the formal documentation of sources and the integration of source materials through summary, paraphrase, and quotation.\nDuring the Winter term we will turn our focus to academic research. Our libraries have an impressive array of traditional and electronic search tools as well as millions of books, journal articles, and assorted media. Although navigating this vast sea of information is intimidating, it is important that you find your way: excellent research skills are fundamental to your undergraduate training, regardless of your chosen field of study. In consideration of its importance, we will spend a significant amount of time learning how to use our library effectively.\nA more detailed description of the course objectives and outcomes may be found in the Writing 2/3 Course Outcomes statement on the Institute for Writing and Rhetoric website.\nSyllabus: Writing 2 Week One:\n10.1.20 Readings Phrygiae petendo suisque extimuit, super, pars quod audet!

If instructed to do so by a professor, include your last name before the page number on each page.\n  Double space the document.\n  Block quotes are formed when a quote runs more than 100 words. Indent the entire block of text with a 1/2-inch tab from the left margin.\n  Endnotes and bibliographic entries are single-spaced with a blank line separating them.\n  Indent the first line of a note entry with a 1/2-inch tab.\n  Indent the second, and any subsequent, line of a bibliographic entry with a 1/2-inch tab.\n  The Chicago form requires a title page. The title of the essay is centered about 1/3 down the top of the page. Place your name, course information, and date on three separate, centered lines at the center of the document.\n  The title page is counted but not numbered. This means that the first page of your essay proper will be numbered 2 and your title page will have no page number on it.\n  Example:       Chicago Notes page formatting The Chicago style has two ways of approaching citation. In one method, known as author-date, references are placed in the text within a parenthesis using the author\u0026rsquo;s last name and the year of the source\u0026rsquo;s publication. The author-date method is common in the sciences and social sciences. A second method is notes and bibliography. In this method in-text citations are made using either footnotes, which appear at the bottom of a page, or endnotes, which appear on a separate Notes page at the conclusion of the document. This handbook only presents the notes and bibliography method with endnotes.\nTo set up your Notes page properly, follow the rules below:\nFormatting the Notes page  Setting up the Notes page When setting up the Notes page, use the following rules:\n  Center the word \u0026ldquo;Notes\u0026rdquo; at the top of the page.\n  Single-space the endnotes with a line separating entries.\n  Indent the first line of an endnote entry with a 1/2-inch tab.\n  Example:     The Bibliography page The Chicago style does not require that you include a bibliography page at the conclusion of your essay; the Notes page is often sufficient unless the work is very long or contains a large number of citations. However, your professor may require one. To construct a Chicago bibliography, follow the rules below:\nFormatting the Bibliography page  Setting up the Bibliography page To format a Chicago bibliography page, use the following rules:\n  Place the bibliography page after the notes page.\n  Center the word \u0026ldquo;Bibliography\u0026rdquo; at the top of the page.\n  Single-space entries with a line separating entries.\n  Alphabetize by the author\u0026rsquo;s last name.\n  Indent the second (and any subsequent) line of an entry with a 1/2-inch tab.\n  Example Chicago Bibliography page:     Chicago in-text citations When using Chicago\u0026rsquo;s notes and bibliography method of citation, in-text citations are made using either footnotes, which appear at the bottom of a page, or endnotes, which appear on a separate \u0026ldquo;Notes\u0026rdquo; page at the conclusion of the document. This handbook exclusively presents the notes and bibliography method using endnotes.\nChicago in-text citations  In-text citations In the Chicago form, an in-text citation is indicated by a superscript number resembling the following:\n Recent scholarship on the concept of sovereignty has displayed a remarkable lack of interest in Native peoples.7\n This in-text reference will correspond to a citation on the Notes page at the conclusion of the document, such as this one:\n7. Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998), 96.   The Chicago Bibliography When making footnotes or endnotes, the Chicago form prescribes a specific strategy designed to lessen the work involved. While this design ultimately means less typing, a number of strict rules must be followed:\n  Present the citations in the numerical order as they appear within the text.\n  The first time a source is cited, use the full Chicago notes form.\n  If the same source is used more than once, the shorthand version of the Chicago notes form is used the second (and each subsequent) time. The shorthand version contains a) the author\u0026rsquo;s last name, b) a shortened version of the title, and c) the page number(s) of the citation.\n  If a source is twice (or more) in a row, the Latin abbreviation \u0026ldquo;Ibid.\u0026rdquo; is used along with the page number, rather than the shorthand version of the form. (Ibid. means \u0026ldquo;in the same place.\u0026quot;)\n  If a source is used twice (or more) in a row and the citation is from the same page, \u0026ldquo;Ibid.\u0026rdquo; is used by itself without the page number.\n  The following section provides examples for citing sources that are commonly found in academic writing. Both the Notes and Bibliography forms are included. The various forms have been organized into sections on books, periodicals, electronic sources, and other types of sources that are less common.\n Click on \u0026ldquo;Bibliography\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Notes\u0026rdquo; to reveal the proper form:  Citing Books Book Forms  A book by one author: Bibliography Bibliography Taylor, Herman.

Citing Online sources Online Forms  The Chicago form prefers that citations of online sources use a DOI (Digital Object Identifier). A DOI is a long string of numbers and letters that provide a unique identifier for an online object, such as an article or book. However, many online objects do not have a DOI. In that case, the Chicago form asks you to use a stable URL. If no stable URL is available, and the URL for your source is very long, you may shorten it to include only the domain name.\n For example: http://www.nytimes.com.  Article in an online database: Bibliography Bibliography Taylor, Hayden. \u0026ldquo;Moby Dick and the Cold War.\u0026rdquo; American Literature 45, no. 6 (2010): 45-57. doi: 12.2398/ahl.483.1.112.Notes Notes 22.

Cite the source as you would a print article then include the DOI or stable URL. If neither exists, end the citation with the database name.

The course focuses on how to acquire knowledge, evaluate evidence, and articulate arguments. We will cultivate these critical practices through rigorous group inquiry\u0026mdash;by reading and analyzing a series of demanding texts and responding to them in the form of essays. Shorter writing assignments will focus on a number of skills that are important for taking part in academic conversations.

Our libraries have an impressive array of traditional and electronic search tools as well as millions of books, journal articles, and assorted media. Although navigating this vast sea of information is intimidating, it is important that you find your way: excellent research skills are fundamental to your undergraduate training, regardless of your chosen field of study. In consideration of its importance, we will spend a significant amount of time learning how to use our library effectively. The theme for this course examines post-apocalyptic fiction, film, and art.\n   Course Materials: Syllabus | Readings | The Open Handbook\n  Assignments: TBA\n  Workshops: TBA | TBA | [TBA\n    Course Policy FAQs Can I email you my essay for extra comments?  No. I usually do not take requests for extra comments via email unless there is no other possible way a student can meet with me in person. However, I am happy to discuss new drafts with students during office hours or at other times by appointment. Considering how easy it is to attach a file to an email, almost every student would seek this additional help. As a result, I would be deluged with requests for help, often at the very last minute, making it impossible for me to thoughtfully respond to them all.   Can I bring my laptop to our office meeting?  No. I have discovered that under these circumstances students often type the words that I say directly into their papers. This potentially blurs the line between critique and authorship. Since it is important that you do your own work, it is best to avoid this problem/temptation by using a hard copy.   I can\u0026#39;t make office hours; can we meet another time?  Yes! I will be happy to accommodate students whose schedules conflict with my office hours. Contact me and we can work out the details. If we are unable to find a time that works for both of us, RWIT is another excellent option.   Can I have an extension?  Sort of. I must be fair to all of my students. If I give an extension to one student, the other students who turned in their essays on time are disadvantaged. For that reason I deduct a full letter grade for each day an assignment is late. Take as much extra time as you wish; however, you should be prepared to face the consequences. Of course, if you have a serious emergency that prevents you from completing work, I will be happy to work out a new due date.   Do you have a grading rubric?  Yes and No. I do not have a formalized rubric to explain the exact nature of the A, B, C, D, and F essay. However, my handbook does discuss the characteristics of all good academic writing.

In MLA the bibliography is known as the Works Cited page. When formatting a Works Cited page, use the following rules:\nMLA Works Cited page formatting    Center the words \u0026ldquo;Works Cited\u0026rdquo; at the top of the page.\n  Use your last name and the page number on the right side of the page\u0026rsquo;s header.\n  Double space the entries.\n  Alphabetize the entries by the author\u0026rsquo;s last name.\n  If an entry runs more than one typed line, indent the second (and any subsequent) line with a 1/2-inch tab.\n  If two or more works by the same author are used, list the entries alphabetically by title. After the first entry, replace the author\u0026rsquo;s name with three dashes followed by a period.\n  Example:     When a quotation runs more than four typed lines, use a block quote. A block quote is a freestanding block of quoted words, set apart from the rest of the text. When formatting block quotes in MLA, use the following rules:\nMLA Block Quote Formatting    Begin the block quote on a new line.\n  Indent every line of the quote 1 inch from the left margin (this should be two tabs).\n  Do not use quotation marks around the quoted material.\n  Place the parenthetical citation after the final punctuation of the quoted passage.\n  Example:     MLA in-text citations The MLA style uses parenthetical citations within a document to indicate the author and page number of sources. Each time a source is used in your text, the author\u0026rsquo;s name and the page number of the source are placed in a parenthesis within your document. These in-text citations correspond to a full bibliographic entry for the source located in the essay\u0026rsquo;s Works Cited page at the conclusion of the essay.\nMLA In-text Citations  The MLA style parenthetical citations primarily take two forms:\n1. One form is used when the source you are citing is named or understood by your audience:\n According to scholar James Frey, \u0026ldquo;Each American consumes five pounds of ice cream annually\u0026rdquo; (78).\n  In this first sentence the author is referred to only as a generic \u0026ldquo;scholar.\u0026rdquo; To give the reader information on which scholar is being cited, Frey\u0026rsquo;s name is included in the parenthetical citation.  2. The other form is used when the author being cited is unknown or unclear based on the context:\n According to scholar James Frey, \u0026ldquo;Each American consumes five pounds of ice cream annually\u0026rdquo; (78).\n  In the second example the author describes the report, not its author; as a result, the student has included Frey\u0026rsquo;s name to the citation to indicate whose report is being referenced.  The in-text citations described above will comprise virtually all of your citations. However, there are a few circumstances when the in-text citations will require a different approach.\n3. For media that has a runtime\u0026mdash;like film, television, or music\u0026mdash;MLA requires that you cite a timestamp within your in-text citations. Use colons to separate hours, minutes, and seconds. For example:\n According to Rushmore Academy\u0026rsquo;s headmaster, Max is \u0026ldquo;probably the worst student\u0026rdquo; at the school (04:04-07).\n or\n In \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t Hurt Yourself,\u0026rdquo; Beyoncé proclaims \u0026ldquo;I am the dragon breathing fire\u0026rdquo; (01:13-15).\n 4. For citations when the author is unknown, use an abbreviated version of the work\u0026rsquo;s title in the parenthetical citation. If no page number is available (for example, if the source was found on the web), just use the abbreviated title in the citation and provide the full bibliographic entry in the Works Cited page:\n Accordingly, the moose population in New Hampshire is suffering from the increased tick population (\u0026ldquo;Not Moosing Around\u0026rdquo;).\n 5. If the source was written by a corporate author, you may use the name of the company, government office, or organization who published the piece in place of the author:\n Scientists declare that this will be the hottest year on record (NOAA 234).\n   The MLA core elements The eighth edition of the MLA Handbook, published in 2016, issued sweeping changes to the formatting of the MLA bibliography. The previous seven editions of the handbook\u0026mdash;stretching back to the 1930s\u0026mdash;attempted to provide a model citation for every type of source. However, the explosion of internet-based sources and new forms of communication and media made the project of providing guidance on every type of source extremely challenging.\nThe new handbook replaces the creation of an ever-growing list of source types with a set of universal guidelines that may be used to formulate a citation for any type of source. These guidelines are referred to as the \u0026ldquo;core elements.\u0026rdquo; The promise of this new approach to the MLA bibliography is that it provides a method for citing any type of source, even those that do not yet exist.\nUsing the core elements  The MLA core elements below are listed in the order they should appear in your own bibliography. The proper punctuation that should follow each element is also provided. Thus, you will begin the entry with the author(s) name, followed by a period. Then the title of the work will be provided, followed by a period. Then the title of the container, followed by a comma. And so on. If one of these core elements does not apply to your source, skip it and move to the next one until you have been through the entire list of elements.\n Note that some sources will have more than one container. If so, you will have to proceed through the second table listed below to complete your bibliographic entry:     Core Element Concluding Punctuation     Author .   Title .   Title of container (self contained if book) ,   Other contributors (translators or editors) ,   Version (edition) ,   Number (vol. and/or no.) ,   Publisher ,   Publication Date ,   Location (pages, paragraphs URL or DOI) .     Some sources have more than one \u0026ldquo;container.\u0026rdquo; If so, continue to the next table to construct your bibliographic entry:     Core Element Concluding Punctuation     2nd container\u0026rsquo;s title ,   Other contributors (translators or editors) ,   Version ,   Number ,   Publisher ,   Publication date ,   Location ,   Date of Access (if needed) .    Using the MLA core elements 1. Author. The first element of a citation is the author\u0026rsquo;s name. Since the MLA bibliography is organized alphabetically by the author\u0026rsquo;s last name, begin your citations with the author\u0026rsquo;s last name, followed by a comma, then the author\u0026rsquo;s first name. If a middle name or initial are supplied, include those after the first name in the entry. Conclude the author element with a period. Sources will often have multiple authors. In that case, only the first listed author will use the Last Name, First Name structure. For example:\nTaylor, Alan. A Tour of New Hampshire\u0026rsquo;s Wolf Trees. Little and Sons, 1998. Greely, Fred, Mary Jones, and Rick Flair. There\u0026rsquo;s a Bat in My Attic: Struggles with the New Hampshire Brown Bat. Wildlife Press, 2012.  2. Title of source. The title of a source is italicized if it is considered \u0026ldquo;self-contained\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;independent.\u0026rdquo; Sources that are part of a larger whole, however, are placed in quotation marks. For example, a book is a self-contained and independent source; however, a chapter in a book is part of a larger whole. Thus, the title of the book will be italicized while the title of the chapter will appear in quotation marks. Similarly, a television series is an independent whole, so its title will be italicized. However, an episode within the television series is part of the larger program, so its title appears in quotations. For example:\nSan, Rathanak. Escaping Vietnam. Peach Publishing, 1988. Taylor, James. \u0026quot;The Indian Matter of Charles Brockden Brown\u0026rsquo;s Writings.\u0026ldquo; American Literature, vol. 45, no. 6, 1998, pp. 432-45. \u0026quot;Say My Name.\u0026ldquo; Breaking Bad, created by Vince Gilligan, performance by Brian Cranston, season 5, episode 7, AMC, 2012.  MLA has a standardized approach to the capitalization of titles. Regardless of how the title appears on a title page, scholarly journal, or database, use the following information to properly capitalize the title of your source on your Works Cited page:\n  Capitalize nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and subordinating conjunctions.\n  Unless they begin the title, do not capitalize articles, prepositions, coordinating conjunctions, or the \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; in infinitive verbs.\n   3. Title of container, Many kinds of sources are smaller parts of larger wholes. MLA refers to these larger wholes as containers. For example, a chapter is a smaller part of a book. In this sense, the book is the container for the chapter. Similarly, a scholarly article is a smaller part of the scholarly journal that contains it. Newspaper articles, essays in a collection, and television episodes are all contained by a larger whole. These containers are italicized in your bibliography. For example, here are the citations for an article in a scholarly journal and a work in a collection of essays:\nTaylor, James. \u0026ldquo;The Indian Matter of Charles Brockden Brown\u0026rsquo;s Writings.\u0026rdquo; American Literature, vol. 45, no. 6, 1998, pp. 432-45. Cranston, William. \u0026ldquo;My Famous Donkey.\u0026rdquo; Short Stories of East Tennessee, edited by Jax Ridley, East Tennessee State P, 2011, pp. 77-90. Some sources have multiple containers. This is often true for electronic sources. For example, a scholarly article may be contained by both the journal that originally published it and the academic research database that hosts it online. Consider an article published in the academic database called JSTOR:\nTaylor, James. \u0026ldquo;The Indian Matter of Charles Brockden Brown\u0026rsquo;s Writings.\u0026rdquo; American Literature, vol. 45, no. 6, 1998, pp. 432-45. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/8759038475. When citing a source make sure that you represent every container so as to truly represent where that source was discovered.\n 4. Other contributors, Your sources will often have a number of other individuals who contributed to the work besides the author(s). You may find sources with one or more of these additional roles:\n  director\n  editor\n  illustrator\n  introducer\n  narrator\n  performer\n  translator\n   5. Version, Many sources are published in more than one version. The most common version you will encounter in academic research is a new version of a book. Each new version of a book is described as an edition. These versions are numbered in sequential order: 1st edition, 2nd edition, 3rd edition, and so on. There are other kinds of versions, some of which are illustrated below.\nAnderson, Wes. Rushmore. 1998. Performance by Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, director\u0026rsquo;s cut, Buena Vista International, 2017. The Bible. Authorized King James Version, Oxford UP, 1998. David, Gray. Blister in the Sun: A Day in the Life of an Aging Rock Star. Revised ed., Primer Publishing, 1993. Smith, John. Raising Arizona. 3rd ed., Primer Publishing, 1993. Always ensure that you cite the exact version that you use in your writing. Pagination often differs between editions; versions of a film or other media may vary significantly or have additional content. Failing to cite the specific version of a text will lead to confusion and may make your readers feel that you are sloppy or uncaring.\n 6. Number, Many sources are part of a numbered sequence. For the most part you will encounter this in journal articles and books that are part of a numbered series.\nJournal articles are often collected together in volumes and numbered issues:\nTaylor, James. \u0026ldquo;The Indian Matter of Charles Brockden Brown\u0026rsquo;s Writings.\u0026rdquo; American Literature, vol. 45, no. 6, 1998, pp. 432-45. Some journals do not collect issues into numbered volumes; instead, they only publish numbered issues:\nClampers, Smitty. \u0026ldquo;Genocide in South America.\u0026rdquo; Journal of Violence, no. 7, 1990, pp. 221-75. When books are too large to be published as a single text, they are organized in volumes:\nSmith, Jeb. A History of American Serial Killers. Vol. 6, Samford UP, 2012.  7. Publisher, A publisher is the business or organization responsible for bringing a book, article, website, or other type of source to the public. Books will commonly indicate the publisher on the title or copyright pages, which will be the first few pages of the text:\nLund, Frank. The Gravest of Errors. Indiana UP, 2012. Websites or blogs may not have clear indications for the publisher. However, this information is often included in the footer at the bottom of a homepage or on \u0026ldquo;About\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Contact\u0026rdquo; pages:\nTeeter, Graham. \u0026ldquo;My Time Alone in Vietnam, a Travel Tale.\u0026rdquo; Narratives from the Edge, Society of World Geographers and Adventurers, www.edgenarratives.com/teeter. Television series and films are often created by a large array of producers and companies. However, cite only the organization that had the primary responsibility for production:\nAnderson, Wes. Rushmore. Performance by Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, Buena Vista International, 1998. The MLA stylebook explains several situations where a publisher\u0026rsquo;s name is not required in the citation:\n  A periodical (academic journal, newspaper, magazine, etc.)\n  A work published by its author.\n  A website whose title is essentially the name of the publisher.\n  A website that does not help produce the source, only host it (academic database, YouTube, etc.)\n  Be careful, however, to include things like the electronic database name or platforms like YouTube as containers, described above.\n 8. Publication date, Most sources appropriate for academic research will clearly disclose the date, or dates, of publication. This information will often appear in the front matter of books or journals, or in the masthead of newspapers.\nOnline sources, however, present a problem. Sometimes it is unclear when an online source was published. Other times the online source may be a digital version of a print source which may have been published at a different time.\nWhen a source has more than one publication date, cite only the version that you are using in your own writing. For example, if you are citing a newspaper article you read online, you should cite the date disclosed on the online version, not the corresponding print version. Failing to do this may cause problems if the online version was edited after the newspaper went to print.\n 9. Location, The location of a source largely refers to a source\u0026rsquo;s page number, or numbers. However, many types of sources do not have page numbers. A web page\u0026rsquo;s location, for example, is a URL. And a painting or some other artwork\u0026rsquo;s location would be the physical location of the museum where you viewed it in person.\n  A chapter in a book:\nTate, Justin. \u0026ldquo;Ordering Wine in Paris.\u0026rdquo; An American\u0026rsquo;s Guide to French Cuisine, U of Tennessee P, 1989, pp. 45-61.   If the source is only on a single page, use p. rather than pp. to indicate the page number.\n  A website:\nGrisham, Wyatt. \u0026ldquo;A Soccer Mom\u0026rsquo;s Lament.\u0026rdquo; Sports and Parenting, 28 Oct. 2017, www.sandp.org/soccermomslament.   URLs can be challenging to present because of their length or mutable nature. If possible, use what is known as a \u0026ldquo;stable url\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;permalink\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;a permanent URL associated with online content. These permalinks will not change over time. You may also find online content with a DOI, a digital object identifier. You may cite this DOI in place of a URL. If a URL is too long to include in your bibliography, you may use a shortened version of the URL by citing the domain name of the source (for example: www.nytimes.com).\n A material object or work of art:  Wayins, Brill. Lone Pine Tree. 2001, Hood Museum of Art, Hanover.\nNote: In previous versions of the style, MLA required the city of the publisher to be included. This is no longer a requirement of the style.\n  The MLA bibliography While the new edition of the MLA Handbook largely dispenses with specific templates for making citations, I have retained the following examples for this edition of the Open Handbook. I find that these examples are still a helpful guide, especially for students who lack experience with this style of citation.\nThe following section provides examples for citing sources that are commonly found in academic writing. The various forms have been organized into sections on books, periodicals, electronic sources, and other types of sources that are less common.\nCiting Books Book Forms  A book by one author: Taylor, Herman. A Tale of One City. Little and Sons, 1998.  Two or more works by the same author(s): San, Rathanak. Escaping Vietnam. Peach Publishing, 1988. - - -. The Golden Triangle. Gray and Long, 1999.  If you cite two works by the same author, use the author\u0026rsquo;s first and last name in the first instance. Use three dashes followed by a period in place of the author\u0026rsquo;s name for any additional works. Place the works in alphabetical order using the first important word in the title.   Two or three authors: Roberts, John, Philip Glass and Jane Hinds. Recovering the City of Boston. U of Massachusetts P, 2000.  Cite the first author using the typical Last Name, First Name format. For each subsequent author, use First Name Last Name.   Four or more authors: Bankston, Jonathan, et al. On Barns. Woodcraft Publishing, 2013.  If a work has four or more authors, you may give the first author\u0026rsquo;s name and replace the other authors with the Latin term \u0026ldquo;et al,\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;and others.\u0026rdquo;   A book with an editor: James, Henry. Portrait of a Lady. Edited by Leon Edel, Houghton, 1963.  If a work has multiple editors, use \u0026ldquo;Editors\u0026rdquo; followed by the editors\u0026rsquo; names in the order they are listed in the source.   An edition (other than the first): Thompson, Fred. Why I Fight. 3rd ed., Vanity Publications, 2000. A republished book: James, Esther. My Life. 1946. Random House, 2001.  A republished book is one that was previously published in a different form, perhaps even from a different publisher. For books of this kind, indicate the original year of publication after the title.   Corporate author (written by organization or government): John Bigam Society. The Religions of Kenya. Nairobi Publishing, 2000. United States, Department of Transportation. State Highway Signage Regulations. Government Publishing Office, 2002.  If the author of a work is a government or institution, use the name of that organization in place of the author. If the text is the publication of a government, include the name of the department or agency.   An anthology: Foner, Eric, editor. An American Voice: A Collection of America\u0026rsquo;s Finest Essays. McKinley and Smith, 2011.  Work in an anthology or collection of essays: Graves, Thomas. \u0026ldquo;The History of our National Anthem.\u0026rdquo; An American Voice: A Collection of America\u0026rsquo;s Finest Essays, edited by Eric Foner, McKinley and Smith, 2011, pp. 20-41.  No author or editor: A Guide to Boston. Beantown Publishing, 2000.  Forward, introduction, preface, or afterward: Knox, John. Introduction. The Life of James, by Elders Johnson, Random House, 2009, pp. 1-8.  A book with a translator: McDougle, Astrid. The Basics of Gaelic. Translated by Paddy Maloney, Vintage, 1990.

Edited by Andrew Stills, Alfred A. Knopf, 1988. History of American Economic Development.  Occasionally, a press will publish a series of books about a single topic. If your source is a book in a published series, indicate the name of the series at the conclusion of the citation.   Dictionary or encyclopedia entry: \u0026ldquo;Suzerian.\u0026rdquo; Merriam-Webster\u0026rsquo;s Collegiate Dictionary. 10th ed., 2008.  If you are citing an entry from a reference text like a dictionary or encyclopedia that is organized alphabetically, you do not need to indicate the page number.   Sacred text: The Bible. Authorized King James Version, Oxford UP, 1998.  If you are citing a particular edition of a sacred text, such as the Bible, Koran, or Torah, include that information.   Book with title within the title: Hixson, Fred. On Cormac McCarthy\u0026rsquo;s Blood Meridian. Plainspeak P, 2000.  If a book title contains the title of another book or article, remove the italics to indicate the title of the other work.    Citing Periodicals Periodical Forms  Article in a scholarly journal with volume and issue numbers: Taylor, James. \u0026ldquo;The Indian Matter of Charles Brockden Brown\u0026rsquo;s Edgar Huntly.\u0026rdquo; American Literature, vol. 45, no. 6, 1998, pp. 432-45.

Article in a newspaper: McKinley, Robert. \u0026ldquo;Cat Saved from Dog.\u0026rdquo; The New York Times, 7 Oct. 2011, p. B2.  When an article appears on nonconsecutive pages, indicate the page where article begins then use a \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; sign.   Letter to the editor of a newspaper: Johnson, Smitty. \u0026ldquo;Reduce our Property Taxes.\u0026rdquo; Letter, Henniker Telegraph, 14 Oct. 2013, p. A2.  A review: Smith, James.

This address will never change and will allow others to find the content easily.\n  Some online sources have what is known as a Digital Object Identifier, or DOI. If the source has a DOI, use it in place of a URL.\n  When using a URL, remove the \u0026ldquo;http://\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;https://\u0026rdquo; that precedes the address. Instead, begin your url with \u0026ldquo;www.\u0026rdquo;\n  If a URL is too long to include in your bibliography, you may use a shortened version of the url by citing the domain name of the source (for example: www.nytimes.com).\n   Article in an online database: Taylor, Abel. \u0026ldquo;Moby Dick and the Cold War.\u0026rdquo; American Literature, vol. 45, no. 6, 2010, pp. 45-57.
