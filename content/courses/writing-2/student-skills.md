# What does it mean to be educated?

Some years ago historian William Cronon [asked](https://www.williamcronon.net/writing/only_connect.html) "What does it mean to be a liberally educated person?" 

> It seems such a simple question, especially given the frequency with which colleges and universities genuflect toward this well-worn phrase as the central icon of their institutional missions. Mantra-like, the words are endlessly repeated, starting in the glossy admissions brochures that high school students receive by the hundreds in their mailboxes and continuing right down to the last tired invocations they hear on commencement day. It would be surprising indeed if the phrase did not begin to sound at least a little empty after so much repetition, and surely undergraduates can be forgiven if they eventually regard liberal education as either a marketing ploy or a shibboleth. Yet many of us continue to place great stock in these words, believing them to describe one of the ultimate goods that a college or university should serve. So what exactly do we mean by liberal education, and why do we care so much about it?

In answering his own query, Cronon elaborates ten characteristics of the liberally educated person. And yet, as he concludes, he states that his original question is "misleading" in that it suggests that education is like a commodity that we may possess at the end of a process of education. "Nothing could be further from the truth," he writes. "A liberal education is not something any of us ever *achieve*; it is not a *state*." Rather, it is a way of living in the face of our own ignorance, a way of groping toward wisdom in full recognition of our own folly, a way of educating ourselves without any illusion that our educations will ever be complete." 

This seems a wise observation and it comports with my understanding about the nature and purpose of education and the nature and purpose of the writing classroom. With that caveat in mind, I'll offer my list of ten attributes of the liberally educated person, focusing on competencies and skills in the rhetorical arts.

# What should students be able to do?

A student should be able to: 

1. **`Analyze.`** Analysis involves breaking a complex thing down into smaller parts so that you can understand how those parts work together to make the whole. Students should be able to tear arguments down to the studs, revealing a text's purpose, structure, and support. This involves identifying a text's `thesis`, `claims`, `evidence`, `reasons`, and `assumptions` (among other things) and how those things work together to make meaning (or fail to do so). Students should also be able to bring this same sort of critical analysis to bear on images, art, spaces, cultural artifacts, and performances of various sorts.

2. **`Read actively.`** Students should not be passive consumers of texts, but active and critical interrogators of what they read. They should recognize specious reasoning and rhetorical manipulation or sophistry.

3. **`Accurately re-present the thinking of others.`** Students should be able to accurately re-present the ideas and arguments of other writers in their own writing. This competency is quite complex as it encompasses several discrete skills: **a)** `reading comprehension`; **b)** `paraphrase,` representing the meaning of another text using different words to an audience who is unfamiliar with the original text; **c)** `summary,` representing the meaning of another text *in abbreviated form* to an audience who is unfamiliar with the original text; **d)** `quotation,` artfully including the *exact words* from another text in your own text.

4. **`Think critically.`** Students should be able to think critically about the arguments and evidence presented by other writers, then assess the value of these arguments and the suitability of the evidence using arguments and reasons of their own.

5. **`Perform theoretical analysis.`** Students should be able to make use of the arguments made by others by applying these found ideas to new contexts. This is often referred to as "theoretical" argumentation or a "lens" essay.

6. **`Make arguments.`** Students should be able to make effective arguments that use `claims` and `evidence` to support a main idea.

7. **`Demonstrate audience awareness.`** Students should be able to think clearly about those people they hope to address and persuade with their arguments, then make appropriate rhetorical choices so as to make their best case.

8. **`Make connections.`** Students should be able to make connections between disparate things---across disciplines, between texts, cultural practices, etc. These sorts of connections allow us to see and understand in new, creative ways. 

9. **`Synthesize.`** Students should be able to explain how two or more distinct arguments or ideas relate to each other to an audience unfamiliar with the texts. A synthesis attempts to discover the various things that the authors discuss in their writing---the questions, ideas, and arguments they have in common---then present those things in an organized and meaningful way. Thus, synthesis seeks to bring two or more distinct sources into a relationship by explaining to the audience the various ways in which the sources are in dialogue.
