# No Silo

This is the repo containing the files to generate the No Silo site, made with Hugo. 

No Silo is the companion site to Alan C. Taylorâ€™s courses at Dartmouth College. The site contains syllabi, course materials, workshops, the Open Handbook project, and other related bits and pieces.

The term No Silo stems from a talk I gave to the faculty of the Institute for Writing and Rhetoric at Dartmouth College in the winter of 2020. The talk was about tearing down information silos and sharing our syllabi, workshops, prompts, and other teacherly artifacts. This site is the natural extension of those ideas.
