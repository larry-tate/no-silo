# What should students be able to do?

Many years ago historian William Cronon asked "What does it mean to be a liberally educated person?" Answering his own query, Cronon elaborates [ten characteristics of the "liberally educated" person](https://www.williamcronon.net/writing/only_connect.html). It's a really good list. You should read it. 

Here is my own list, focusing on competencies and skills in the rhetorical arts:

1. **`They analyze.`** Analysis involves breaking a complex thing down into smaller parts so that you can understand how those parts work together to make a whole (or fail to do so). Students should be able to tear arguments down to the studs, revealing a text's purpose, structure, and support---exposing the weakness or strength of construction. This practice involves identifying a text's `thesis`, `claims`, `evidence`, `reasons`, and `assumptions` (among other things) and how those things work together to make meaning (or fail to do so). Students should also be able to bring this same sort of critical analysis to bear on images, art, spaces, advertisements, memes, cultural artifacts, and performances of various sorts.

2. **`They read actively and think critically.`** Students should not be passive consumers of texts, but *active and critical interrogators* of what they read. Students should be able to think critically about the arguments and evidence presented by other writers, then assess the value of these arguments and the suitability of the evidence using arguments and reasons of their own making. Students should recognize specious reasoning and rhetorical manipulation or sophistry when they see it. They should ask deep, probing questions of the ideas and arguments they encounter, forcing each text to earn their assent. Active, critical readers imagine the experience of reading as a dialog, a conversation that we have with another person.

3. **`They accurately re-present the thinking of others.`** Students should be able to accurately re-present the ideas and arguments of other writers in their own writing. This competency is quite complex as it encompasses several discrete skills: **a)** `reading comprehension`; **b)** `paraphrase,` representing the meaning of another text using different words to an audience who is unfamiliar with the original text; **c)** `summary,` representing the meaning of another text *in abbreviated form* to an audience who is unfamiliar with the original text; **d)** `quotation,` artfully including the *exact words* from another text in your own writing.

4. **`They synthesize.`** Students should be able to explain to a broad audience how two or more distinct arguments or ideas relate to each other. A synthesis attempts to discover the various things that the authors discuss in their writing---the questions, ideas, and arguments they have in common---then present those things in an organized and meaningful way. Thus, synthesis seeks to bring two or more distinct sources into a relationship by explaining to the audience the various ways in which the sources are in dialogue.

5. **`They use theories.`** Students should be able to make use of the arguments made by others by applying these found ideas to new contexts. This is often referred to as "theoretical" argumentation or a "lens" essay.

6. **`They make sound arguments.`** Students should be able to make effective arguments that use `claims,` `evidence,` and reasoning to support a main idea or `thesis`.

7. **`They demonstrate audience awareness.`** Students should be able to think clearly about those people they hope to address and persuade with their arguments, then make appropriate rhetorical choices so as to make their best case.

8. **`They make connections.`** Students should be able to make connections between disparate things---across disciplines, texts, theories, cultural practices, etc. These sorts of connections allow us to see and understand in new, creative ways. 

9. **`They remain vulnerable to new ideas & information.`** Students should know that they don't know everything---that there are other ways of seeing and knowing that they may not even know exist. Some of these ideas and views may be deeply challenging or even incommensurable with their own deeply held views and beliefs. Yet, students should be able to cultivate a spirit of openness, generosity, and understanding---an intellectual and emotional vulnerability to new ideas and the experiences of others. This is not a facile nihilism, but an openness to discovery. 

10. **`They inquire.`** 

At the conclusion of his list, Cronon offered a caveat that I think is very wise. He says that his question and answer are ultimately rather misleading, because it "suggests that one can somehow take a group of courses, or accumulate a certain number of credits, or undergo an obligatory set of learning experiences, and emerge liberally educated at the end of the process. Nothing could be further from the truth. A liberal education is not something any of us ever achieve; it is not a state. Rather, it is a way of living in the face of our own ignorance, a way of groping toward wisdom in full recognition of our own folly, a way of educating ourselves without any illusion that our educations will ever be complete."
