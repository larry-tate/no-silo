# Writing 2

---

**Writing 2** is an introduction to academic writing and research. The course prepares you for work in a scholarly environment where you will be expected to engage in inquiry, perform analysis, and communicate clearly. We will cultivate these critical practices by reading and analyzing a series of demanding texts and articulating responses to them in the form of essays. Shorter writing assignments will focus on a number of skills that are important for taking part in academic conversations. Among these are the formal `documentation of sources` and the integration of source materials through `summary,` `paraphrase,` and `quotation.`
