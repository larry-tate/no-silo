Writing 2 is an introduction to academic writing. The course focuses on how to **acquire knowledge**, **evaluate evidence**, **think critically**, and **make effective arguments**. We will cultivate these critical practices through rigorous group `inquiry`--- by reading and analyzing a series of demanding texts and responding to them in the form of essays. Shorter writing assignments will focus on a number of skills that are important for taking part in academic conversations. Among these are the formal [**documentation of sources**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11/) and the integration of source materials through [**summary**](https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/), [**paraphrase**](https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/), and [**quotation**](https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/).
