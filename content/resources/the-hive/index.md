## The Hive

[**The Hive**](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu) is a shared repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings. We will build this resource together as a class---sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course readings we encounter. With luck (and some effort), `The Hive` will become a central resource in our class discussions and an indispensable aid to you as you craft your essays.

Our objective for `The Hive` is to explore meaning, discover argumentative structure, evaluate supporting evidence, ask probing questions, connect to other readings, link to relevant resources, and think critically about the implications of a text.

## How to contribute

You might contribute to `The Hive` by doing some of the following tasks:

1. Help create a simplified version of the argument structure by presenting an ordered list of argumentative claims, reasons, and evidence. 

2. Ask a question about a difficult passage in the text or offer an answer one posed by another student.

3. Define difficult vocabulary.

4. Quote a portion of the essay that seems worthy of discussion or analysis and explain why it seems significant, or build on the thought of another student who has done so. 

5. Make a connection between an idea found in one text with others we have read in class (or elsewhere).

6. Constructively question, respond, or correct the ideas or work of another student.

## Cite your work

During this process, cite yourself to identify your contributions to the hive using a tag formed from your initials. For example, here is a truncated contribution with my initials:
