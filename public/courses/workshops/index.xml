      <description>Argument Analysis Workshop Relying on your annotations, critical notes, and our discussion of the text, construct an outline of Nicholson Baker&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Changes of Mind&amp;rdquo; essay.
Your focus here is on the essay&amp;rsquo;s argumentative structure. Baker is a very playful writer, so there is a lot of silliness and verbal excess here. This makes it challenging to distinguish an argumentative claim from his examples, stories, and evidence. Your job is to carefully sift through this essay, isolating the arguments and presenting them as a stripped-down, organized list of statements.</description>

      <description>Argument Summary Workshop Write a summary of Nicholson Baker’s argument in “Changes of Mind” that is no more than 250 words.
Include all of Baker’s argumentative claims or assertions. Leave nothing out. Put nothing extra in. Remain objective. Do not tell the audience your opinions or how you feel about Baker&amp;rsquo;s writing or argument. Just give us the facts.
  Don’t forget to provide MLA-formatted citations indicating the page number(s) of the points you summarize.</description>
