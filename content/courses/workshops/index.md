# Workshops & Lectures

This term we will do a series of workshops designed to learn and practice various skills needed for academic writing and research. 

{{< tabs "Workshops" >}}

{{< tab "Purpose" >}} 

The purpose of these workshops is largely diagnostic; they will not, of themselves, make you a better writer. However, they will help reveal things that you struggle with as a writer. Think of these workshops as tools for self-assessment---you will use them to gain insight into your own abilities and create a plan for improvement. Significantly, *you may revise these workshops as many times as you wish*; thus, every student should get 100% on each of these assignments. To me, the grade is not important; what matters is that you become more proficient writers and thinkers.
