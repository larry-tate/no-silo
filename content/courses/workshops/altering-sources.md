# Altering sources

---

Integrating quotations from other sources is an important part of academic writing. However, doing so is rarely a simple process of cutting and pasting the words from another source into your document. For example:

- What do you do when you writing in the present tense and the source material you are quoting uses the past tense? 

- What if the sentence you want to quote contains extraneous words or phrases that are a distraction from your intended purpose? 

- What if a term in your quotation needs some sort of clarification so that your audience will understand what meaning you intend? 

- What if you need to change the capitalization of a letter in the source text after placing it within the context of your writing?

Issues such as these are a common problem in academic writing. So, what do you do? 

This exercise will introduce you to *ellipsis* and *brackets* which are used to alter source material during quotation.

-*From* Walker Percy, "The Loss of the Creature," p. 47.

>Why is it almost impossible to gaze directly at the Grand Canyon under these circumstances and see it for what it is—as one picks up a strange object from one's back yard and gazes directly at it? It is almost impossible because the Grand Canyon, the thing as it is, has been appropriated by the symbolic complex which has already been formed in the sightseer's mind. Seeing the canyon under approved circumstances is seeing the symbolic complex head on. The thing is no longer the thing as it confronted the Spaniard; it is rather that which has already been formulated—by picture postcard, geography book, tourist folders, and the words Grand Canyon. As a result of this preformulation, the source of the sightseer's pleasure undergoes a shift. Where the wonder and delight of the Spaniard arose from his penetration of the thing itself, from a progressive discovery of depths, patterns, colors, shadows, etc., now the sightseer measures his satisfaction by the degree to which the canyon conforms to the preformed complex.

## Workshop

Using the source text provided above, write the sentences or paragraphs assigned below. For help with ellipsis, brackets, quotation, and paraphrase, read the chapter in the *Open Handbook* on [altering sources](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8). 

1. Write a sentence involving a quotation from the passage, use ellipsis to show an omission, then cite according to MLA. The ellipsis must be for an omission in the *middle* of a single sentence. 
2. Quote a portion of this passage using ellipsis to show an omission, then cite according to MLA. The ellipsis *must remove the ending of one sentence and the beginning of another*. 
3. Use square *brackets* in a quotation to give the reader clarifying information, then cite according to MLA. 
4. Use square *brackets* in a quotation to alter capitalization.


5. Write a complete *paraphrase* of this text. Think of paraphrase as a translation from English into English---express the same ideas as another writer but use your own words and sentence structure. Cite in MLA accordingly.


6. Rewrite your *paraphrase*, but this time integrate some of the author’s language (in the form of short quotations) that you feel is significant or memorable. Cite in MLA accordingly.
