      <description>Preface College students are commonly required to purchase handbooks for use in their writing courses. These reference texts introduce students to the conventions of academic writing and often include chapters on academic research, critical thinking, grammar, and formal citation.
The knowledge contained in these texts is indispensable. However, most handbooks on the market today are bloated in both content and price (I think the former is often the justification for the latter).</description>

      <description>Essay Three: Theoretical Analysis  In Rushmore, Max Fischer has an insatiable appetite for extracurricular activities: fencing, bee-keeping, yankee racers, calligraphy, backgammon, theater, and on and on and on. These projects and clubs are forms of self-improvement&amp;mdash;kinds of sovereign inquiry&amp;mdash;but they completely dwarf his responsibilities in the traditional disciplines of formal education: geometry, history, English, etc. According to Dr. Guggenheim, Max is &amp;ldquo;one of the worst students&amp;rdquo; at Rushmore Academy.</description>

      <description>Essay Two: Synthesis  Percy and Freire, each in their own way, ask us to consider the problem of authority within educational systems or experiences. Write an essay that synthesizes their thinking, explaining how they both investigate the nature of this problem, examine its consequences, and offer solutions.
As the name suggests, synthesis essays focus on combining and connecting. Your focus in a synthesis essay is to explain to your audience the ways in which two or more arguments or ideas relate to one another.</description>

Our libraries have an impressive array of traditional and electronic search tools as well as millions of books, journal articles, and assorted media. Although navigating this vast sea of information is intimidating, it is important that you find your way: excellent research skills are fundamental to your undergraduate training, regardless of your chosen field of study. In consideration of its importance, we will spend a significant amount of time learning how to use our library effectively.</description>

      <description>Annotation and Critical Reading   &amp;ldquo;There is something predatory, cruel even, about a pen suspended over a text. Like a hawk over a field, it is on the lookout for something vulnerable. Then it is a pleasure to swoop and skewer the victim with the nib&amp;rsquo;s sharp point. The mere fact of holding the hand poised for action changes our attitude to the text. We are no longer passive consumers of a monologue but active participants in a dialogue.</description>

      <description>Critical Notes   &amp;ldquo;We believe the best way to work on a difficult text is by rereading . . . but you can also work on the difficult text by writing, by taking possession of the work through sentences and paragraphs of your own, through summary, paraphrase, and quotation, by making another writer&amp;rsquo;s work part of your work&amp;rdquo; (12).

      <description>Audience   &amp;ldquo;[A] work of rhetoric is pragmatic; it comes into existence for the sake of something beyond itself; it functions ultimately to produce action or change in the world; it performs some task. In short, rhetoric is a mode of altering reality, not by the direct application of energy to objects, but by the creation of discourse which changes reality through the mediation of thought and action.</description>

      <description>The Joy of Reuse  Save all your work Most students complete their school work, turn it in to their professor, then never think of it again. These efforts then cross the event horizon into the black hole of a computer hard drive, never to emerge again. If this sounds like your standard practice, consider a change now that you&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at college. When you write something (essays, notes, reports, projects, code), or when you use something (course readings, research, data), keep a copy of it in some organized folder system so you may return to it in the future.</description>

      <title>5. What is Good Writing?</title>

      <description>What is Good Writing?  Academic writing takes many forms. However, all good academic writing shares several basic characteristics:
  Good academic writing always contains a strong thesis statement: an idea, stated as an assertion, that is the work&amp;rsquo;s central focus.
  Good academic writing is organized: each paragraph builds upon the one before it, creating a strong sense of purpose. The paragraphs themselves are unified, generally pursuing a single idea that helps support the thesis.</description>

      <guid>https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/chapter-6/</guid>
      <description>Types of College Writing  Most students are trained in high school to write what is known as a five-paragraph essay&amp;mdash;a form of writing containing an introduction, three paragraphs of support, and a summary conclusion. In that it encourages students to think about introductions, structure, organization, paragraphing, evidence, and reasoning, the five-paragraph essay is good training for novice writers. However, this particular rhetorical form is extremely limiting: only certain, rather paltry, thoughts and ideas may be placed within a five paragraph structure.</description>

      <description>Paragraphs &amp;amp; Topic Sentences   I can remember picking up my father&amp;rsquo;s books before I could read. The words themselves were mostly foreign, but I still remember the exact moment when I first understood, with a sudden clarity, the purpose of a paragraph. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the vocabulary to say &amp;quot;paragraph,&amp;quot; but I realized that a paragraph was a fence that held words. The words inside a paragraph worked together for a common purpose.</description>

      <description>Working with Sources   The ugly fact is books are made out of books.
&amp;ndash;Cormac McCarthy
  Academic writing always involves integrating the thinking of others into your own writing. There are only three ways that the words and ideas of others may appear in your writing: summary, paraphrase, and quotation. Writing an academic paper requires a mastery of all three skills. It is critical to always give credit to the other authors whose ideas or words you borrow.</description>

&amp;ndash;Aelius Donatus
  Definition of plagiarism In the Academic Honor Principle, Dartmouth College defines plagiarism as
 the submission or presentation of work, in any form, that is not a student&amp;rsquo;s own, without acknowledgment of the source. With specific regard to papers, a simple rule dictates when it is necessary to acknowledge sources. If a student obtains information or ideas from an outside source, that source must be acknowledged.</description>

      <description>Altering Sources  In your life as a writer you will frequently encounter situations where you must alter a source quotation in some way. Generally, these alterations are used to satisfy grammar or make your writing easier to follow by removing or adding words or phrases.
  To indicate that we have removed words from a source text we use ellipses . . . a series of periods to mark where something has been removed from the source.</description>

      <description>Academic Research  You are right to be wary. There is much bullshit. Be wary of me too, because I may be wrong. Make up your own mind after you evaluate all the evidence and logic.
&amp;mdash;Mark Rippetoe
  Research writing involves a number of important skills: library research, critical thinking, the evaluation of sources, and the ability to synthesize information through summary, paraphrase, and quotation. Although synthesizing the thinking of others is an important part of the research essay, in its true form the research essay strives for much more than a mere restatement of what others have said on a particular topic or question.</description>

      <description>On Style  I don&amp;rsquo;t usually talk about style with students, or teach it in any way. But some of the best advice on style I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read came from Gary Provost&amp;rsquo;s 100 Ways to Improve Your Writing:
 This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring.</description>

      <description>Documentation of Sources  Accurately documenting sources is a vital aspect of any process of inquiry. If you fail to properly document your sources, your readers will be unable to follow your research, validate your claims, or judge the quality of your argument. Furthermore, failing to properly cite a source (whether summarized, paraphrased, or quoted) opens you to the charge of plagiarism, a serious academic offense.
Scholars avoid plagiarism and give credit to the thinking and writing of others using a variety of citation formats, or &amp;ldquo;styles.</description>

      <description>Common Sentence Errors  A statistical study of student writing performed in 1988 by scholars Andrea Lunsford and Robert Connors demonstrated that virtually 100% student writing mistakes are limited to 20 formal errors. Eliminating these errors in your writing therefore offers the quickest path to error-free prose.

      <description>Annotation  In college you will encounter demanding texts of great complexity. You will be asked to engage these texts critically and to challenge the thinking and conclusions of others. You will also have to retain an extraordinary amount of information and recall it later. To thrive in this environment, you will need to develop some new habits and strategies. The most basic, and most fundamental, of these is a formal procedure for the annotation of texts.</description>

      <description>Argument Analysis  Analysis involves breaking an argument down into smaller parts so that you can understand how those parts work together to make the whole. During this class we will try to train our minds to uncover the argumentative structure of all that we read. One of the most helpful tools for analysis is annotation&amp;mdash;the making of marks and symbols on the text itself.
Relying on your annotations, critical notes, and our discussions of the text, construct an outline of the argument found in Nicholson Baker&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Changes of Mind&amp;rdquo; essay.</description>

      <description>Argument Summary  In a summary you present the ideas of another writer in a condensed form. The length of a summary is dictated by your rhetorical needs, but they are always shorter than the original text. For example, the summary of a large book could be 20 pages, one paragraph, or one sentence. Although a summary sacrifices specificity and detail in the interest of brevity, it must always remain a faithful representation of the original text&amp;rsquo;s meaning.</description>

      <description>Argument Synthesis  What is synthesis? As the name suggests, synthesis involves combining and connecting. Your focus in a synthesis essay is to explain to your audience the ways in which two or more arguments relate to each another.
Students attempting synthesis for the first time often make the mistake of organizing their essays by source. For example, they will introduce two authors in their introduction, summarize Author A for a few paragraphs, summarize Author B for a few paragraphs, then conclude the essay by noting the broad similarities and differences in the two authorsâ€™ thinking.</description>

      <description>Core Competencies in the Rhetorical Arts  Many years ago, historian William Cronon described the ten characteristics of a &amp;ldquo;liberally educated&amp;rdquo; person. It&amp;rsquo;s a really good list. You should read it.
Here is my own list, focusing on the core competencies of the rhetorical arts. As I see it, the following are the most critical skills for successful writing and thinking in an academic context. None of these things is particularly easy to master, if such a thing is actually possible.</description>

      <title>On Sentence Variety</title>

      <description>Sentence Variety  Integrating quotations from other sources is an important part of academic writing. Often, student writers who write sentences well in their own voice have difficulty when they try to weave the voices of others into their prose. I also find that most students have developed a particular strategy or formula for quotation that they use over and over again as a kind of crutch. In the recent batch of essays, I saw that many of you habitually rely on the same sentence structure when introducing a quotation from a source.</description>

      <description>Peer Review Work  Step I: Make a basic outline Construct a brief outline of your partner&amp;rsquo;s essay by listing the main idea contained in each paragraph. Your focus should be on the paper&amp;rsquo;s argumentative structure, so concentrate on identifying the essay&amp;rsquo;s thesis and the supporting claims. Approach each paragraph as if it were a single unit of meaning. What claim does it make? What is its purpose?</description>

      <description>Altering sources  Integrating quotations from other sources is an important part of academic writing. However, doing so is rarely a simple process of cutting and pasting the words from a source into your own document. Instead, you will routinely encounter challenges in the quotation of a source that threaten the clarity and correctness of your prose. For example:
  What do you do when you writing in the present tense and the source material you are quoting uses the past tense?</description>

      <description>Working with Sources Documentation, quotation, summary, paraphrase  Accurately documenting sources is a vital aspect of any process of inquiry. If you fail to properly document your sources, your readers will be unable to follow your research, validate your claims, or judge the quality of your argument. Furthermore, failing to cite a source (whether summarized, paraphrased or quoted) opens you to the charge of plagiarism, a serious academic offense.</description>
