      <description>Preface College students are commonly required to purchase handbooks for use in their writing courses. These reference texts introduce students to the conventions of academic writing and often include chapters on academic research, critical thinking, grammar, and formal citation.
The knowledge contained in these texts is indispensable. However, most handbooks on the market today are bloated in both content and price (I think the former is often the justification for the latter).</description>

      <title>1. Annotation &amp; Critical Reading</title>

      <description>The Open Handbook Annotation and Critical Reading  There is something predatory, cruel even, about a pen suspended over a text. Like a hawk over a field, it is on the lookout for something vulnerable. Then it is a pleasure to swoop and skewer the victim with the nib&amp;rsquo;s sharp point. The mere fact of holding the hand poised for action changes our attitude to the text. We are no longer passive consumers of a monologue but active participants in a dialogue.</description>

      <description>Critical Reading  &amp;quot;We believe the best way to work on a difficult text is by rereading . . . but you can also work on the difficult text by writing, by taking possession of the work through sentences and paragraphs of your own, through summary, paraphrase, and quotation, by making another writer&amp;rsquo;s work part of your work&amp;quot; (12).

      <title>3. Audience</title>

      <description>Audience  [A] work of rhetoric is pragmatic; it comes into existence for the sake of something beyond itself; it functions ultimately to produce action or change in the world; it performs some task. In short, rhetoric is a mode of altering reality, not by the direct application of energy to objects, but by the creation of discourse which changes reality through the mediation of thought and action. The rhetor alters reality by bringing into existence a discourse of such a character that the audience, in thought and action, is so engaged that it becomes mediator of change (3-4).</description>

      <title>4. The Joy of Reuse (Save Your Work)</title>
      <link>https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/chapter-4/</link>

      <description>The Joy of Reuse (Save Your Work) Save all your work Most students complete their school work, turn it in to their professor, then never think of it again. These efforts then cross the event horizon into the black hole of a computer hard drive, never to emerge again. If this sounds like your standard practice, consider a change now that you&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at college. When you write something (essays, notes, reports, projects, code), or when you use something (course readings, research, data), keep a copy of it in some organized folder system so you may return to it in the future.</description>

      <title>5. What is Good Writing?</title>
      <link>https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/chapter-5/</link>

      <description>What is Good Writing? Academic writing takes many forms. However, all good academic writing shares several basic characteristics:
  Good academic writing always contains a strong thesis statement: an idea, stated as an assertion, that is the work&amp;rsquo;s central focus.
  Good academic writing is organized: each paragraph builds upon the one before it, creating a strong sense of purpose. The paragraphs themselves are unified, generally pursuing a single idea that helps support the thesis.</description>

      <title>6. Types of College Writing</title>
      <link>https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/chapter-6/</link>

      <description>Types of College Writing Most students are trained in high school to write what is known as a five-paragraph essay&amp;mdash;a form of writing containing an introduction, three paragraphs of support, and a summary conclusion. In that it encourages students to think about introductions, structure, organization, paragraphing, evidence, and reasoning, the five-paragraph essay is good training for novice writers. However, this particular rhetorical form is extremely limiting: only certain, rather paltry, thoughts and ideas may be placed within a five paragraph structure.</description>

      <title>7. Paragraphs and Topic Sentences</title>
      <link>https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/chapter-7/</link>

      <description>Paragraphs &amp;amp; Topic Sentences  I can remember picking up my father&amp;rsquo;s books before I could read. The words themselves were mostly foreign, but I still remember the exact moment when I first understood, with a sudden clarity, the purpose of a paragraph. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the vocabulary to say &amp;quot;paragraph,&amp;quot; but I realized that a paragraph was a fence that held words. The words inside a paragraph worked together for a common purpose.</description>

      <title>8. Working with Sources</title>
      <link>https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/</link>

      <description>Working with Sources  The ugly fact is books are made out of books.
&amp;ndash;Cormac McCarthy
 Academic writing always involves integrating the thinking of others into your own writing. There are only three ways that the words and ideas of others may appear in your writing: summary, paraphrase, and quotation. Writing an academic paper requires a mastery of all three skills. It is critical to always give credit to the other authors whose ideas or words you borrow.</description>

      <title>9. Altering Sources</title>

      <description>Altering Sources In your life as a writer you will frequently encounter situations where you must alter a source in some way. Generally, these alterations are used to satisfy grammar and/or make your writing easier to follow by removing or adding words or phrases.
  To indicate that we have altered or added words to a source text in our own writing we use square brackets: [ ]
  To indicate that we have removed words from a source text we use ellipses&amp;mdash;a series of periods to mark where something has been removed from the source.</description>
