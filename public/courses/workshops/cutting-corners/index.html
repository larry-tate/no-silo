<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of times a first-year student has waited until the other students left the classroom in order to sheepishly approach me ask this question: &ldquo;Professor, if I get a book from the library or download an article for my research project, do I have to read the <em>whole thing</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIrWyr3HgXI">Don&rsquo;t be silly</a>; of course not.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you a secret: professors don&rsquo;t read everything in their field of study either. There is just too much information and it appears too rapidly to carefully consume and metabolize. It&rsquo;s akin to drinking out of a fire hose. <em>What this means is that you have to make choices</em>. What are your priorities? Given the time and interest you have, which texts look worth a slow, patient, deeply critical reading? And yet, professors somehow also keep abreast of all the work happening in their field of study. How do they do that?</p>
<p>Professors and other gods of research have developed a set of skills specifically designed for this purpose. You should consider adopting these as well. Professors and very strong students have developed extremely efficient forms of reading and several attendant practices that can take the place of reading a text from beginning to end. These skills are very applicable to first-year students who need to write a long research essay on an unfamiliar topic in a short 10-week term.</p>
<h2 id="on-reading-ruthlessly">On Reading Ruthlessly</h2>
<p>Nothing can replace carefully reading a book or article from beginning to end. But often there is not time or a need to do so. Before you try to read something in its entirety, an activity that could take hours or even days, you should perform several tests on the text to decide if it is worth your time:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Skim the prefatory material</strong>. Scholarly books always contain a page that lists the chapters and other content. It may be that, upon examining this list, you can zero in on a single chapter that is relevant to your interests and skip the rest. Similarly, academic articles sometimes contain an &ldquo;executive summary&rdquo; written by the author that gives you an overview of the entire work in a single paragraph. Looking over these materials may lead you to read the work more carefully or jettison it for something better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read the introduction</strong>. In many academic works, the introduction will contain a concise statement about the main argument(s) of the text and, near the end, tight descriptions of each individual chapter. The benefit of reading this are obvious: reading (or perhaps just heavily skimming) the introduction will provide you with an excellent summary and overview of the text. Introductions also frequently contain what are known as a &ldquo;literature reviews,&rdquo; where the scholarly conversation that surrounds the particular topic in question is summarized and the contribution the book offers to this critical context is described. The other texts and authors mentioned in the literature review may be quite useful to you as well, so take note to check out or download these texts as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read the conclusion</strong>. The conclusions of books, chapters, or articles are places where the author tries to state the worth and relevance of their work. These passages are often very revealing as they tell you quite a lot about whether the text&rsquo;s earlier content will be useful or in sync with your project, arguments, and ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scan the topic sentences</strong>. One final test may be to skim the topic sentences of each paragraph in a work. Since the topic sentences generally state the paragraph&rsquo;s purpose, you can generally size up a text by reading them alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read book reviews.</strong> Academic works are often reviewed by other academics in the pages of related academic journals. If you place the book&rsquo;s title in the search field and use the search delimiter for &ldquo;review articles&rdquo; you should receive a list of reviews that have been published in academic, peer-reviewed journals. These reviews are usually only 2-3 pages in length, offer a precise summary of the book&rsquo;s contents, and make some evaluative remarks at the end about the book&rsquo;s worth or importance.</p>
