<p>Periodicals are publications that are published at regular intervals, such as scholarly journals, magazines, and newspapers. Examining periodicals—especially academic journals—is an important aspect of research. Since books often take a year or more to go through the process of peer review, editing, typesetting, and printing before they become available for purchase, they often do not contain the most current information. Articles, on the other hand, appear in a far shorter period of time and generally contain the most up-to-date research. For that reason, you should perform a review of journal articles on your research topic to ensure that you are aware of recent discoveries, arguments, and debates within the academic community who share your research focus.</p>
<p>However, a common problem for undergraduate researchers is not knowing which databases or journals are appropriate to search for information on a particular topic. There is no shame in this: unless you are a professional scholar, it is difficult to know what the leading journals are in a particular field of study. This is also a problem for faculty performing research outside of their areas of expertise. For example, an English professor would know that the academic journal PMLA or the database JSTOR are excellent places to look for articles on Herman Melville’s novel Moby Dick, but the novice researcher or historian might not know where to begin.</p>
<p>To resolve this problem, our library has organized periodical databases by discipline in the <a href="https://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/az.php">Database Finder</a>. You may also browse alphabetically if you know the name of the database you are looking for. This is designed to help you locate the specific journals, periodical databases, and reference materials that are appropriate for each discipline or research subject.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are unsure where to begin, try using the JSTOR and/or Web of Science databases as they have broad disciplinary coverage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="workshop">Workshop</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find <strong>JSTOR</strong>, <strong>Web of Science</strong>, and <strong>Academic Search Complete</strong> databases. Each database is different, so you will have to familiarize yourself with how it works. Get to know these databases by searching using some keywords that you associate with your research project. Use the same search strings in each of the databases and see how the results differ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although it is very important to use <a href="/courses/workshops/search-with-precision/">Boolean searches</a> within the databases, many databases offer additional search delimiters (generally located in the left pane as a series of check boxes) that allow you to further refine your searches. You may, for example, only return peer-reviewed or full-text sources; or you may select that you only want books and articles, not newspapers or book reviews. Try to refine your search terms with this feature in each of the databases.</p>
