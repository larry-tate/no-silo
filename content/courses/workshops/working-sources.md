# Working with Sources

## Documentation, quotation, summary, paraphrase

---

Accurately documenting sources is a vital aspect of any process of inquiry. If you fail to properly document your sources, your readers will be unable to follow your research, validate your claims, or judge the quality of your argument. Furthermore, failing to cite a source (whether summarized, paraphrased or quoted) opens you to the charge of [**plagiarism**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-10), a serious academic offense. With this in mind, it is vital that you become acquainted with how to document sources in your writing.

But citation is not the most difficult aspect of working with source texts. One must also learn how to artfully use [**signal phrases**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8) to announce borrowed ideas or words. There are also the important skills of [**summary**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8) and [**paraphrase**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8), and knowing when it is best to use one or the other. And then there is [**quotation**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8), which often makes a jumble of your prose if it is not done thoughtfully. Each of these individual skills must be orchestrated together by the author; they require practice and patience. We won't become professionals by doing this assignment, but it may give you insight into things you need to work on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it almost impossible to gaze directly at the Grand Canyon under these circumstances and see it for what it is—as one picks up a strange object from one's back yard and gazes directly at it? It is almost impossible because the Grand Canyon, the thing as it is, has been appropriated by the symbolic complex which has already been formed in the sightseer's mind. Seeing the canyon under approved circumstances is seeing the symbolic complex head on. The thing is no longer the thing as it confronted the Spaniard; it is rather that which has already been formulated—by picture postcard, geography book, tourist folders, and the words Grand Canyon. As a result of this preformulation, the source of the sightseer's pleasure undergoes a shift. Where the wonder and delight of the Spaniard arose from his penetration of the thing itself, from a progressive discovery of depths, patterns, colors, shadows, etc., now the sightseer measures his satisfaction by the degree to which the canyon conforms to the preformed complex.

4. *Paraphrase* this entire passage in your own words without using the author’s name and then cite according to MLA. Briefly quote language or terms to give the reader a sense of the "flavor" of Baker's paragraph.Think carefully about your audience: if they have not read this piece, how should you explain things to them so that they will understand?
