Writing 2 is an introduction to academic writing. The course focuses on how to **acquire knowledge**, **evaluate evidence**, **think critically**, and **articulate effective arguments**. We will cultivate these critical practices through rigorous group `inquiry`--- by reading and analyzing a series of demanding texts and responding to them in the form of essays. Shorter writing assignments will focus on a number of skills that are important for taking part in academic conversations. Among these are the formal [`documentation of sources`](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11/) and the integration of source materials through [`summary`](https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/), [`paraphrase`](https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/), and [`quotation`](https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/).

Writing 3 focuses on academic research. Our libraries have an impressive array of traditional and electronic search tools as well as millions of books, journal articles, and assorted media. Although navigating this vast sea of information is intimidating, it is important that you find your way: excellent research skills are fundamental to your undergraduate training, regardless of your chosen field of study. In consideration of its importance, we will spend a significant amount of time learning how to use our library effectively. The theme for this course examines `post-apocalyptic` fiction, film, and art.

## Course Policy FAQs

{{< details "Can I email you my essay for extra comments?" >}}

#

## No.

I usually do not take requests for extra comments via email unless there is no other possible way a student can meet with me in person. **However, I am happy to discuss new drafts with students during office
hours or at other times by appointment**. Considering how easy it is to attach a file to an email, almost every student would seek this additional help. As a result, I would be deluged with requests for help,
often at the very last minute, making it impossible for me to thoughtfully respond to them all.

{{< details "Can I bring my laptop to our office meeting?" >}}

#

## No.

I have discovered that under these circumstances students often type the words that I say directly into their papers. This potentially blurs the line between critique and authorship. Since it is important that you do your own work, it is best to avoid this problem/temptation by using a hard copy.

{{< details "I can't make office hours; can we meet another time?" >}}

#
## Yes!

I will be happy to accommodate students whose schedules conflict with my office hours. Contact me and we can work out the details. If we are unable to find a time that works for both of us, [RWIT](https://students.dartmouth.edu/rwit/) is another excellent option.

{{< details "Can I have an extension?" >}}

#
## Sort of.

I must be fair to all of my students. If I give an extension to one student, the other students who turned in their essays on time are disadvantaged. For that reason I deduct a full letter grade for each day an assignment is late. Take as much extra time as you wish; however, you should be prepared to face the consequences. Of course, if you have a serious emergency that prevents you from completing work, I will be happy to work out a new due date.

{{< details "Do you have a grading rubric?" >}}

#
## Yes and No.

I do not have a formalized rubric to explain the exact nature of the A, B, C, D, and F essay. However, my handbook does [discuss the characteristics of all good academic writing](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-5).
