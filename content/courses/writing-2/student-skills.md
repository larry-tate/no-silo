# What should students be able to do?

Many years ago historian William Cronon asked "What does it mean to be a liberally educated person?" Answering his own query, Cronon elaborates [ten characteristics of the "liberally educated" person](https://www.williamcronon.net/writing/only_connect.html). It's a really good list. You should read it. 

Here is my own list, focusing on competencies and skills in the rhetorical arts:

1. **`They analyze.`** Analysis involves breaking a complex thing down into smaller parts so that you can understand how those parts work together to form a whole (or fail to do so). Students should be able to expose the weakness or strength of an argument's construction by tearing them down to the studs, revealing a text's purpose, structure, and support. This practice involves identifying a text's `thesis`, `claims`, `evidence`, `reasons`, `allusions,` and `assumptions` (among other things). Students should also be able to bring this same sort of critical analysis to bear on images, art, spaces, advertisements, memes, cultural artifacts, and performances of various sorts.

2. **`They read actively & think critically.`** Students should not be passive consumers of texts, but *active and critical interrogators* of what they read. Students should be able to think critically about the arguments and evidence presented by other writers---assessing the value of these arguments and the suitability of the evidence. Students should recognize specious reasoning and sophistry when they see it. They should ask probing questions of the ideas and arguments they encounter, forcing each text to earn the conclusions they present. Active, critical readers imagine the experience of reading as a dialog, a conversation that we have with another person through the medium of text.

3. **`They accurately re-present the thinking of others.`** Students should be able to accurately re-present the ideas and arguments of other writers in their own writing. This competency is more complex that it appears as it encompasses several discrete skills: `reading comprehension,` `paraphrase,` `summary,` and `quotation.` 

4. **`They synthesize.`** Students should be able to explain to a broad audience how two or more distinct arguments or ideas relate to each other. A synthesis involves discovering the various questions, ideas, and arguments two or more texts have in common, then presenting those things in an organized and meaningful way to an audience. Thus, synthesis seeks to bring two or more distinct sources into a relationship by explaining to the audience the various ways in which the sources are in dialogue.

5. **`They use theories.`** Students should be able to make use of the arguments made by others by applying these found ideas to new contexts. This is often referred to as "theoretical" argumentation or a "lens" essay.

6. **`They make sound arguments.`** Students should be able to make effective arguments that use `claims,` `evidence,` and `reasoning` to support a main idea or `thesis`. 

7. **`They demonstrate audience awareness.`** Students should be able to think clearly about those people they hope to address and persuade with their arguments, then make appropriate rhetorical choices so as to make their best case. An awareness of the audience will often lead to providing appropriate contextualizing information designed to help readers gain clear understanding.

8. **`They make connections.`** Students should be able to make connections between disparate things---across disciplines, texts, theories, cultural practices, etc. These sorts of connections allow us to see and understand in new, creative ways. 

9. **`They remain vulnerable to new ideas & information.`** Students should know that they don't know everything---that there are other ways of seeing and knowing that they may not even know exist. Some of these ideas and views may be deeply challenging to their own deeply held views and beliefs. They may, in fact, be utterly incommensurable. Yet, students should be able to cultivate a spirit of openness, generosity, and understanding---an intellectual and emotional vulnerability to new ideas and the experiences of others. This is not a facile nihilism, but an openness to discovery and a recognition of one's own fallibility. 

10. **`They inquire.`** Good students are curious; they love learning for its own sake and view education as a process of exploration, discovery, and personal *becoming*. They seek truth and wisdom. They know that education is not something that we can ever fully achieve; it is not a state of being. Rather, it is something that forever eludes our grasp.
