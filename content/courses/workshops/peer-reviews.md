# Peer review

Peer review is a form of quality control in academic publishing. Before books or articles are published, they experience a rigorous process of evaluation by a number of experts who have advanced training in the field of study in question. The "referees" are not known to the author of the piece being reviewed. This anonymity theoretically ensures a more honest appraisal of the work unders consideration for publication. When it works as intended, this scholarly review helps eliminate factual errors and other problems before the works are published. Thus, peer-reviewed works are more trustworthy than other sources of information.

## Determining if a source is peer reviewed

For novice researchers, distinguishing peer-reviewed sources from other published information can be challenging. However, there are a number of things you can do to ensure that you are using peer-reviewed information. First, most peer-reviewed books are published by academic presses that are associated with a college or university of repute. The publisher will have names like: University of Tennessee Press or Duke University Press. Academic journals will frequently declare that their articles are peer-reviewed on their website or in the journal issue itself. If you are confused about a source, ask your professor or one of the research librarians for assistance in making a determination.

## Tests for peer review

If are unable to easily determine if a source is peer-reviewed, here are a few test criteria that you may use to make a judgment call:

- Scholarly, peer-reviewed articles almost always written by credentialed scholars (often the text will contain the university affiliation of the professor/author/scientist).
- Scholarly articles always have a bibliography page.
- Scholarly articles always contain citations and commonly have footnotes or endnotes.
- Generally speaking, if you can find the publication at the dentist’s office or on an airport magazine rack, then it isn’t scholarly or peer-reviewed. *Time*, *Newsweek,* even the *New York Times* are not considered peer-reviewed sources.
- If the article contains advertisements, it is likely not scholarly.
  

## How to find peer-reviewed sources

Many periodical databases, such as JSTOR, *only* contain peer-reviewed academic articles. Many other databases, such as Academic Search Complete, have search limiters that can be selected to ensure that the search results only contain peer-reviewed sources. Our own library search through the Primo discovery layer provides the ability to limit the search to peer-reviewed books and periodicals.

## Workshop

In a non-pandemic year, I usually bring in several sources and ask students to determine if they are peer-reviewed or not.
