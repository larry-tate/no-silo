# Argument Analysis Workshop

Relying on your [annotations](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-1), [critical notes](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-2), and our discussion of the text, construct an outline of Nicholson Baker's "Changes of Mind" essay.

Your focus here is on the essay's *argumentative structure*. Baker is a very playful writer, so there is a lot of silliness and verbal excess here. This makes it challenging to distinguish an argumentative claim from his examples, stories, and evidence. Your job is to carefully sift through this essay, isolating the arguments and presenting them as a stripped-down, organized list of statements.
