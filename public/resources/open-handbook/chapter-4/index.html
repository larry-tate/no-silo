<h1 id="the-joy-of-reuse-save-your-work">The Joy of Reuse (Save Your Work)</h1>
<h2 id="save-all-your-work">Save all your work</h2>
<p>Most students complete their school work, turn it in to their professor,
then never think of it again. These efforts then cross the event horizon
into the black hole of a computer hard drive, never to emerge again. If
this sounds like your standard practice, consider a change now that
you&rsquo;ve arrived at college. When you write something (essays, notes,
reports, projects, code), or when you use something (course readings,
research, data), keep a copy of it in some organized folder system so
you may return to it in the future.</p>
<p>Taking the time to meticulously save all this work may sound
counterintuitive&mdash;the class is over, right? But that essay you wrote
freshman year, the notes you took on a scholarly article, the readings
you dutifully annotated in your history class, may be very useful to you
in some future project that you can&rsquo;t anticipate now. Summarily tossing
all of your work into the black hole forces you to start over again and
again.</p>
<p>While it is important to save your finished work, it is also critical
that <em>you save the research, notes, or data that contributed to that
project as well</em>. Try, as best you can, to capture <em>all</em> of the inputs
that led to your finished work and save them in some organized way.
Successful scholars and students return to prior work and research all
the time&mdash;reshaping, repurposing, and extending prior efforts. They
understand that knowledge is cumulative: it accretes and deepens over
time, often by building on what came before. <em>This is the joy of reuse</em>.</p>
<h2 id="staying-organized">Staying organized</h2>
<p>To retain your work and stay organized, you might use a simple paper
system made up of manila folders. Or you might use a hierarchical folder
system on your computer organized by class, project, or term.
Alternatively, you might embrace a powerful bibliographic manager like
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>. Whatever you choose, create a system for
staying organized and stick with it.</p>
<h2 id="a-poor-file-saving-strategy">A poor file-saving strategy</h2>
<p>I assume that most students today will embrace an electronic system to
manage their workflows, take notes, and compose texts. Let&rsquo;s imagine two
archive systems to store this typical scholarly work. Here is the first, which I don&rsquo;t recommend:</p>
<div class="container">
        <div class="raised-edge">
  <pre><font color="#859900"><b>/</b></font>
└── <font color="#859900"><b>My Documents</b></font>
    ├── Essay.docx
    ├── hack-dartmouth.py
    ├── ideas.docx
    ├── MyDog_Rex.jpg
    ├── Nosetalgia.mp3
    ├── Notes2.doc
    ├── Notes.doc
    ├── Revision.docx
    └── syllabus.pdf
</pre>      
 <div class="edge-shadow"></div>
        </div>
      </div>        
<h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>The strategy represented here breaks down very quickly for two reasons.
First, after a few weeks of accumulating notes, readings, research, and
other important documents, a system with no hierarchically organized
folders becomes a confusing and unhelpful jumble. Secondly, the choices
for naming the files actively resist discovery and recognition. What,
for example, is the subject of <code>Notes.docx</code>? What class was it from? What lecture? Of the many essays you wrote
last term, which one is <code>Essay.docx</code>? And <code>Revision.docx</code> is a revision of what, precisely? A year from now you won&rsquo;t remember, but you may very well care at that time. Unfortunately, the folder into which you&rsquo;ve dumped these files will have swelled to a debilitating size that will disrupt any attempt to make use of your hard work.</p>
<h2 id="a-better-file-saving-strategy">A better file-saving strategy</h2>
<p>Instead of this haphazard and unhelpful approach, each time you place an
artifact in your archive, think about your future self who will want to
find something quickly, with minimal effort. An important first step in
this process is to adopt some kind of logical foldering structure that
quickly reduces the effort of finding a particular item. You should make
considered and thoughtful decisions about your archive&rsquo;s structure.
Perhaps you will choose to organize your work by year, or term, or
class, or project. There are pluses and minuses to any organizational
schema, but changing things up later is difficult, so choose wisely.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most critical step in the construction of your scholarly
archive is to adopt a <strong>strict naming convention</strong> for your folders and
files. Keep in mind sociologist Kieran Healy&rsquo;s <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/plain-person-text.pdf">helpful
advice</a> that
a &ldquo;file or folder should always be able to tell you what it is&rdquo; (7)
without actually having to open it. Taking this sound advice to heart,
we might revise the previous filing strategy like this:</p>
<div class="container">
        <div class="raised-edge">
<pre>
<font color="#859900"><b>/</b></font>
└── <font color="#859900"><b>My Documents</b></font>
    ├── <font color="#859900"><b>Courses</b></font>
    │   ├── <font color="#859900"><b>CS1-F20</b></font>
    │   │   └── hack-dartmouth.py
    │   └── <font color="#859900"><b>Writing23-F20</b></font>
    │       ├── essay1-draft1-090720.docx
    │       ├── essay1-draft2-91520.docx
    │       ├── notes-Freire-110520.docx
    │       ├── notes-Percy-102820.docx
    │       ├── workshop2-draft1-101720.docx
    │       └── WR23-syllabus.pdf
    ├── <font color="#859900"><b>Music</b></font>
    │   └── Pusha-T-Nosetalgia.mp3
    └── <font color="#859900"><b>Photos</b></font>
        └── 2018-MyDogRex.jpg
</pre>
 <div class="edge-shadow"></div>
        </div>
      </div>    
<h1 id="heading-1"></h1>
<p>Your system will obviously become far more complex than the simplified
example presented above. You might, for example, want to create
subfolders within a class to further organize your files. However, the
key features of a good filing system are detectable here: 1) there is a
logical structure to the organization, using course names and file types
to determine the names of the folders and 2) the naming convention for
the folders and files tell you exactly what they are without having to
open them. There is no right or wrong way to make a filing system, and
one size will not fit all. You will have to determine for yourself what
system makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="very-large-filing-systems">Very large filing systems</h2>
<p>Most students will find the simple filing system
described above adequate for their needs. But if
you have an expectation of a very large file system, or if you plan to
share a file system with other researchers, you should consider a
slightly different approach. Large collections of files are quite
difficult to manage; this is especially true when additional researchers
are involved with saving and editing files in the shared directory.
Special care in the naming of files and folders is critical here to
avoid confusion and lost data.</p>
<ul>
<li>While each project is different and will require its own approach,
there are two best practices that should be followed in any shared
research repository: 1) a plaintext <strong>README</strong> file in each project
directory and 2) <strong>a shared naming convention</strong> for files and
folders, described below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-readme-files-for-large-filing-systems">Using README files for large filing systems</h2>
<p>A README file is simply a plaintext file that contains general
information about a project. It functions like a roadmap that helps
other researchers orient themselves to a new project and coordinate
their efforts more easily. Information in a README might include some of
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A short overview of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The names and contact information of the researchers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An inventory list of all the data or documents within a directory
(with a short description of what they are).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the project involves software: a description of installation,
dependencies, how to report bugs, licensing, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Descriptions of file versions, if they are revised in some way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are multiple subfolders (as in the example at right), those
folder paths should be clearly indicated to show their location and
contents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dated list of updates to the project as they occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggested naming conventions for files and subfolders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Descriptions of how other interested researchers can join you and
your work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Descriptions of possible avenues for future work with the data or
project.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="back-up-all-your-data">Back up all your data</h1>
<p>All of this hard work of organizing will be for nothing, however, if you
don&rsquo;t take pains to back up your data. <em>Please, I beg of you, back up
all your data regularly and keep a copy separate from your main working
computer</em>. There are heartbreaking stories of people losing years of
work in a hard drive failure, theft, or house fire/flood. Very few
people are disciplined enough to back up their work regularly on their
own initiative; instead, you should embrace some kind of <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2007/09/psa-backups/">regular,
automated system</a> to
ensure your work will survive any tragedy.</p>

<p>At some point in the future you will boot up your laptop and it will
begin smoking, or be infected by ransomware, or display the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death">BSoD</a>. You will
have no backups. As you cry salty tears you will remember reading
these words and not doing anything about it.</p>
